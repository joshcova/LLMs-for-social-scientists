1,6/29/1972,Labour Party,labour,Mr. Wilson,"special drawing rights were a step in the right direction, but only a step. the problem will not be solved until there is a world currency independent of national treasuries and central banks. as long as there are vulnerable and unstable national currencies, to say nothing of reserve currencies, there can be no guarantee against the kind of hurricane we all felt last week."
2,2/29/1972,Labour Party,labour,Mr. Tam Dalyell,"he raises the question of the accepting houses. the white paper says:
the accepting houses were not informed by the bank of england that the sum of Â£42 million to be provided by the government would be subject to check by the independent accountants, because this check was essentially a matter of determining the exact sum to be paid by the government to rolls-royce, and the bank of england took the view that it was not a matter of such significance as to require them to draw it specifically to the attention of the accepting houses. 
the question that arises is as to the whole role of the bank of england in these difficult events."
3,2/13/1973,Labour Party,labour,Mr. Tam Dalyell,"that issue concerns the role of the bank of england. in the debate on 29th february 1972 i quoted the white paper on rolls-royce and the rb211, which said:
the accepting houses were not informed by the bank of england that the sum of Â£42 million to be provided by the government would he subject to check by the independent accountants, because this check was essentially a matter of determining the exact sum to be paid by the government to rolls-royce, and the bank of england took the view that it was not a matter of such significance as to require them to draw it specifically to the attention of the accepting houses. i then said:
the question that arises is as to the whole role of the bank of england in these difficult events."
4,3/12/1975,Labour Party,labour,Sir Brandon Rhys Williams,"where does the european fund fit in? and do we want the fund to be subject to political influence like the bank of england or the federal reserve board, or relatively independent like the bundesbank and sited away from a political centre? as regards the premises in luxembourg, i believe a single room has been taken so that the fund appears to be sited within the community, but it is operated in fact from the


bank for international settlements in basle."
5,2/25/1976,Conservative Party,conservative,Mr. Nelson,"if i correctly judge the enormity of the words and the allegations that my hon. friend put to the minister, he may be interested to comment on these words of the minister:
we question the view that the principles to be applied by the bank of england in assessing the adequacy of banks' capital are directly applicable to giro as if it were an independent bank."" [official report, standing committee b; c. 162.]"
6,2/25/1976,Conservative Party,conservative,Mr. Nelson,"if that is the case and to some extent this is recognised, by the publishing of separate accounts for the giro it seems to us that one is recognising that it is a separate entity, and that it should therefore be subject to the same rules, requirements and scrutiny as those operating in the private sector, and subject to the commercial constraints and requirements that the bank of england places on those banks in terms of the capital structure which they have to sustain. the minister of state said in committee:
we question the view that the principles to be applied by the bank of england in assessing the adequacy of banks' capital are directly applicable to giro as if it were an independent bank."" [official report, standing committee b; 10th february 1976, c. 162.]
under the proposed capital reconstruction giro will continue to have negative free capital resources that is to say, the public dividend capital of giro will be Â£3Â·7 million less than the accumulated deficit."
7,3/13/1978,Labour Party,labour,Mr. Davies,"as i see it, the hon. member was suggesting, on the one hand, that we must have a statute, which i think is quite unrealistic, and, on the other hand, that the bank of england should be independent in these matters. i do not see how the hon."
8,2/25/1976,Conservative Party,conservative,Sir George Young,"that is the argument which the financial secretary also used earlier this evening. more worrying is what was also said by the minister:
we question the view that the principles to be applied by the bank of england in assessing the adequacy of banks' capital are directly applicable to giro as if it were an independent bank."" [official report, standing committee b, 10th february 1976; cc. 158 “62.]
in making that comment the minister was, in part, withdrawing the assurance he gave us on second reading that competition with the banks would be fair."
9,2/19/1979,Labour Party,labour,Mr. John Ellis,"however, one learns along the way. my own sub-committee has dealt with many matters, including water authorities, the bank of england, cable and wireless, the independent broadcasting authority and even the tote. it has been a valuable experience looking at all those industries and getting some expertise in those areas."
10,4/7/1975,Conservative Party,conservative,Mr. Amery,"heath) attended, as circulated to ministers, read more like the old commonwealth conferences before the expansion of the commonwealth than like any federal or supranational organisation. it may well be that the sterling area, with its system of independent central banks banking their reserves voluntarily with one of their number, will be the next stage in a european monetary union. the european economic community is already 17 years old."
11,5/3/1978,Conservative Party,conservative,Sir Michael Havers,"central banks always occupy a curious position. they are very independent certainly our bank of england is and one knows of a number of central banks of foreign states which are very jealous of their independence, which they carefully guard. we believe that problems

could arise under local law with regard to the capacity of a state to consent on behalf of a central bank to proceedings being taken against funds."
12,6/13/1978,Conservative Party,conservative,Sir M. Havers,but it is a highly technical matter. the amendment follows an issue that i raised in committee basically because the independence of the central banks is jealously guarded by them. it is essential that they should be put into an entirely independent position throughout the bill.
13,3/13/1978,Conservative Party,conservative,Mr. Lawson,"the recreation of a real measure of parliamentary control over monetary policy is desirable not only in itself, which indeed it is, if monetary policy is as important as most people now agree that it is and if parliament is to assert itself, as i believe it should. it is also important as the only practical means of reconciling a greater degree of independence for the bank of england with what might be termed the democratic imperative. on the question of independence, i agree with the conclusion of dr."
14,3/13/1978,Conservative Party,conservative,Mr. Lawson,"parliamentary democracy, which is what we have had always adhered to in this country and attempted to export not always successfully to the rest of the world, has far more to do with open discussion and parliamentary control. in case any of this seems like airy-fairy theorising, far removed from the real world, let me quote finally from a well-known former practitioner, the last governor of the bank of england, lord

o'brien, who said in an address last december,
i believe there is also a case for governments, that is the executive branches of governments, to share part of their power over central banks and monetary policy with parliaments  ¦ this point is particularly relevant for the united kingdom  ¦ i, for one, believe that if the bank of england were made more directly accountable to parliament the bank would, paradoxically, gain a degree of further independence because the governor would be given a platform which present constitutional arrangements have hitherto denied him. if the present government are prepared to travel along this route, which would be in the interests of parliament and of sound monetary policy alike, then they have our blessing."
15,2/25/1975,Conservative Party,conservative,Mr. Jenkin,whatever the outcome and i should like the right hon. gentleman to be aware of this the episode will have done lasting damage to the credibility and independence of the bank of england as a lender of last resort. i was about to make that point when my hon.
16,2/21/1978,Labour Party,labour,Mr. Sheldon,"the formation of a mechanistic relationship a blind addiction to looking at the barometer without looking out of the window to see whether it is raining is unwise, and i am very frightened of the use of instruments in that way. the role that the opposition see for the greater independence of the bank of england, which they forecast in ""the right approach to the economy"", brings to my mind some unpleasant comparisons with the situation before the war, when montague norman was in charge. however, even under him, the government had some control over what is and must remain an essential part of the economy."
17,2/21/1978,Labour Party,labour,Mr. Sheldon,"friends to support the government amendment in the division lobbies later this evening. as last time there was an unwelcome russian visitor the then labour government endeavoured to placate the russian government by handing over the total state gold reserves of the sovereign independent republics of estonia, latvia and lithuania which had been deposited with the bank of england for safe keeping against the eventuality of these countries being invaded by soviet russia do not the government's threats to withdraw the british army of the rhine, coincident with another russian visit to this country [interruption.] suggest that the business for this coming week will once again include an attempt by a labour government to placate this country's enemies? i join the hon."
18,6/16/1980,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Julian Amery," perhaps more important than the tariff and quota and commodity agreements side was that there was a single currency   sterling. that had the great advantage that, as all the central banks of the territories, whether independent, such as australia, or dependent, such as the african territories, banked their reserves with the bank of england, any fluctuations in the terms of trade did not have to be settled overnight with balances built up in favour of the raw material producers when raw material prices were high and run down when the terms of trade went the other way. the result was a spectacular improvement in the conditions both of this country and of the countries with which we were politically associated."
19,3/24/1981,Labour,labour,Mr. Clinton Davis,"i believe that that formula will avoid the domination of working members by a single section of the market   a possibility that has caused some anxiety. there are also the external members and the independent persons, whose role i hope will be impartial, and whose appointments will be confirmed by the governor of the bank of england.  the numerical balance proposed by the right hon."
20,12/6/1982,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Aitken,"friend agree also that it is essential to restore confidence in lloyd's by putting an end to the present shambolic atmosphere of leaks, rows and scandals? does he agree also that probably the best and quickest way to do that is to follow the apparent advice of the governor of the bank of england and to appoint an independent chief executive of lloyd's who would do the job of regulation which the present chairman and committee are so manifestly failing to do? it has been a good and full debate, in which all of the contributions from both sides of the house have materially advanced what we all want to do today."
21,2/24/1983,Labour,labour,Mr. Phillip Whitehead,"not all quarters, including some sections of the conservative press, wholeheartedly approved that gentleman's outstanding qualifications for the post. the daily telegraph, having attacked the appointment in its editorial and been somewhat dismissive of it, could find only one thing to say in his favour in its city column, which said:
 he may have that independence of mind so valuable in a central banker that comes from eton and oxford, from possession of a country estate and the lord-lieutenancy of kent"".  to borrow a phrase from my noble friend lord annan, if i may so describe him, we wish to see not just the great and the good but sometimes the lesser and the better as chairmen and trustees of these bodies."
22,11/22/1983,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,"is that right? the bank of england still trades upon its old, pre-1945 independence, but it is now no more than a well-paid arm of the treasury. it seems rather odd when i hear from some of my friends, whose names i shall not reveal, that the figure of 90 per cent."
23,12/17/1984,Conservative,conservative,Mr Lawson,"that is why i thought it right to have in inquiry into the adequacy of banking supervision in this country: both the way in which the existing system is operated, and whether it statutory framework needs to be improved. as to whether there should be an internal inquiry, or a public inquiry, because of the nature of the matter it is right that it should be an internal inquiry, which will involve not only the bank of england but the treasury and an independent consultant.  as for when i knew about it, the governor notified me of the action which he intended to take shortly before the rescue was announced."
24,12/17/1984,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lawson,"that consultant has not yet been appointed. may we be told how the bank of england could act as an independent adviser in the case, say, of johnson matthey when the bank has already offered Â£75 million in the rescue programme? is the right hon."
25,12/17/1985,Social Democratic Party,labour,Mr. Ian Wrigglesworth,"although the establishment of the new board is a welcome step, will he confirm that all its members will be appointed by the governor of the bank of england? does he agree that it would be much better if the bank of england carried on its role as a central bank like other central banks and that the supervisory function should be carried out by an independent board? will he consider that possibility?"
26,12/17/1985,Social Democratic Party,labour,Mr. Ian Wrigglesworth,"will he also note that the other provisions in the statement are a welcome strengthening of the present regime? the board of banking supervision will make an independent report of its own, to be contained within the annual report of the bank of england. what it chooses to report will inevitably be governed by the laws concerning banking confidentiality."
27,12/17/1985,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lawson,"secondly, the duty of supervising british banks is not laid upon the treasury but is laid, and will be quite clearly laid by the legislation to which i have referred, on the bank of england. therefore, there will be a duty laid on the bank of england to have supervisory staff of the appropriate quality and calibre and also to have independent outsiders to ensure that there is a strengthening of the enforcement of supervision at the top. will the right hon."
28,1/14/1986,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Brittan,"and learned gentleman tell me in what way the body which he has in mind will be more independent, more free-standing than the securities and investment board, jointly appointed by the governor of the bank of england and the secretary of state? no. there is little in lloyd's recent history to inspire confidence."
29,1/14/1986,Labour,labour,Mr. Gould,"there have been the problems with the inland revenue that necessitated the huge inquiry, the resignation of the bank of england appointed chief executive following a row about his independence, the difficulty in prosecuting admitted criminals at lloyd's and the failure to compensate investors in the pcw and other syndicates for their losses. it could be said that lloyd's role in that affair was to obstruct rather than to help investors. the white paper itself received a general welcome and i hope that the bill will meet the same response."
30,11/28/1986,Conservative,conservative,The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Ian Stewart),"the bill provides for a new board of banking supervision to advise the bank of england in its exercise of the powers conferred upon it, and the majority of the members of the board will be independent of the bank of england. the distinction between recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers will be ended, and with it the separate systems of supervision and regulation which applied to the two categories. more frequent supervisory visits to institutions will, therefore, be possible, and a programme of inward and outward secondments to strengthen the commercial experience of supervisory staff has been introduced."
31,11/28/1986,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Stewart," although in some countries banking supervision is conducted by bodies independent of the central bank and the government, international practice varies widely and it is clear that each country should make the arrangements most suited to its circumstances. for many years before the 1979 act, the bank of england was engaged in informal supervision and since 1979 this has been put on to a statutory basis. following the decision to establish an independent board to deal with other financial activities, the government considered whether it would be sensible to establish a separate supervisory body for the banking sector."
32,11/28/1986,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Stewart,"however, given the knowledge and experience of banking supervision built up within the bank of england in recent years, we concluded that the bank should continue to be the supervisory authority in this area but that the system should be strengthened by introducing an element of independent advice and judgment into the process.  therefore, the bill establishes a new board of banking supervision, which provides for advice to be given to the governor and his senior colleagues on supervisory matters. the rules for the board will require that its outside members are always in a majority at its meetings and the board will make its report to parliament through the annual report of the bank of england."
33,11/28/1986,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Stewart,"if, in any case, the bank of england decides not to follow the advice of the independent members, the ex-officio members of the board will be required to notify the chancellor of the exchequer.  the conduct of supervision will be subject to continual review by the board, which the government believe will add greatly to the experience available to the bank of england in taking what are inevitably sometimes extremely difficult decisions. the eventual decision seems to be that there should be no separation along the lines that have been developed in many other countries."
34,11/28/1986,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Anthony Nelson,"however, there are some arguments in favour of at least strengthening the independence and role of a supervisory authority within the central bank, even if it is not to be entirely separate.  it is suggested that where a supervisory authority is within the central bank, and where the board of banking supervision is within the bank of england, conflicts of interest could arise between the regulatory responsibilities of the board, and the central bank's prudential role.  my next point relates to the role of the independent members of the supervisory board."
35,11/28/1986,Liberal,Others,Mr. Penhaligon,"i note that the legislation states that if the independent members disagree with the bank of england members, they can report to the chancellor. does that mean that they meet separately and independently? we intend to table amendments to give the supervisory board a certain degree of independence."
36,11/28/1986,Labour,labour,Dr. McDonald,"however, at least in terms of representation on the board, the question of how far it should be independent of the bank of england is a matter that should be discussed thoroughly in committee.  reference has also been made to large exposures, and doubts were raised on that matter from both sides of the house. as a bank, morgan grenfell is subject to the supervisory authority of the bank of england and to the terms of the banking act."
37,1/20/1987,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lawson," the bank of england was closely involved in setting up and determining the terms of reference of the high-level internal inquiry into the management of morgan grenfell, which was announced last week and, at the governor's suggestion, the inquiry team is now to be strengthened by the addition of a senior independent auditor. the group chief executive of morgan grenfell and the director at the head of its corporate finance division have today announced their resignations, and an executive committee of the board will manage the group pending the appointment of replacements.  i have no reason to think that this will be a cosy system."
38,2/19/1987,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Stewart,"it seems that the advisory functions of the independent members will greatly strengthen the system and will be of great value to the bank of england. i am sure that the bank will not lightly disregard the comments of the independent members either about specific matters of supervision or more general questions, such as those which my hon. i beg to move amendment no."
39,2/19/1987,Labour,labour,Dr. McDonald,"5, in page 2, line 25, at end insert 
 and to resign from the board immediately on the commencement of an investigation by the bank of england into a bank in which the independent member has a position of responsibility'.  in his reply to the hon. i beg to move, that this house doth agree with the lords in the said amendment."
40,5/7/1987,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Ian Stewart," it has always been the government's intention that the independent members of the board of banking supervision should be in a majority, and that is accepted by the bank of england. the provision that is set out in paragraph 3 of the schedule gives a degree of flexibility to change the total number of board members if it proved desirable to do so in future.  at one time the chancellor was even more extreme than the prime minister."
41,3/21/1988,Labour,labour,Mr. Robert Sheldon,"he wanted to enable the bank of england, through legislative powers, to decide these matters independently of the house of commons. he held that view in 1977, and, although he may wince at the recollection, we can at least congratulate him on changing. sooner or later the british people will turn to more equitable ways of running the economy, and i hope that they will do that before too long."
42,6/23/1988,Social Democratic Party,labour,Dr. Owen,"will the prime minister support in hanover next week the proposed study by the central bankers for a european independent central bank? does she agree that that would be the mechanism whereby the freeing of capital flows would be a success, so that in the longer term united kingdom domestic interest rates might come down to the oecd average? member for plymouth, devonport (dr."
43,6/30/1988,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Heath,owen) asked her a question about a european independent central bank. my right hon. the answer is that we would see the independent sovereign states coming into action.
44,10/24/1988,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Curry,"what would happen if five independent sovereign states   for example, the french, the germans, the dutch, the belgiums and somebody else   said that they would get together and create a central bank and a common currency, and do those things which they think are necessary? we forget that our membership can be a constraint upon as well as a spur to the action of others. gentleman said, there is an important omission."
45,3/20/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Julian Amery,it is curious that nobody has talked about restoring to the bank of england the independence which it had before 1948. it did not have complete independence. should we go back to it?
46,3/20/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Julian Amery,"should we try to institutionalise our counter-inflationary policies by giving the bank of england greater independence?  i ask those questions in the context of our fight against inflation, as they are the only things that i can think of which might add to the clear commitment of my right hon. ought we not to be thinking about the longer term?"
47,3/20/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Julian Amery," is it possible that greater independence allowed to the bank of england might help us in the international sphere? it is inevitable, and right, that we will have a lot of discussion about a possible european currency, a possible european reserve bank or a possible european central bank. member for brighton, pavilion (mr."
48,3/20/1989,Labour,labour,Mr. Brian Sedgemore,"amery) that monetary policy could be cured by some administrative changes and that one of those changes should be that the bank of england should be given an independence which it has not had since it was nationalised. as he began his argument, i thought that he would suggest that we should return to the gold standard at the same time. friend the member for brighton, pavilion (mr."
49,3/20/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Neil Hamilton,"amery), i hope that we may think again of establishing an entirely independent control of the money supply by privatising the bank of england.  in this as in many walks of life, it is politicians who cause the difficulties with which we must grapple. they may not have a bean, but their advice, and the contribution they can make, would be vital."
50,5/3/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Jeremy Hanley,"it is surely in the public interest that the frc should remain independent and that not just its chairman but all its members should be appointed by the secretary of state and the governor of the bank of england. payment should take the form of a levy on all limited companies of only Â£6 for every firm registered at companies house. is it not widely recognised in the city that london would be the obvious centre for a central european bank, and that britain should be in the european monetary union of which that central bank would be a part?"
51,7/6/1989,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"from a counter-inflationary point of view, would it not be better if that central bank had more of the independence enjoyed by the bundesbank, rather than the relationship that the bank of england has with the government? gentleman setting an additional condition that before the labour party can consent to britain joining the european monetary system, it must be clear that the bundesbank and any future european central banks will not be independent of government? the trouble with the right hon."
52,10/24/1989,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"sheldon), who chairs the public accounts committee, who suggested that an independent bundesbank was an obstacle to british membership of the ems. there will continue to be an independent bundesbank, and if we had more central bank independence in this country there might have been more effective discipline than there has been here for the past 20 years. we have learnt from the opposition this afternoon that a central part of their policy is to devalue the pound against other currencies."
53,10/24/1989,Conservative,conservative,Peter Hordern,"we should align ourselves to the deutschmark and the erm, and that is the government's policy. in the best of all possible worlds we would have an independent central bank. in the old days we were tied to the gold standard, and that was regarded as the height of british sovereignty."
54,10/24/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Julian Amery,"in the short time allowed, i want to return for a moment to a point that i made in the budget debate earlier this year. i suggested that it was time that the government considered restoring to the bank of england some of the old independence it had until 1948. i thought that that was a rather radical proposal for an elderly privy councillor to make, but nobody paid it the slightest attention."
55,10/24/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Julian Amery,"unlike any other country, britain created a reserve currency of its own, the sterling area. we had a single reserve currency, sterling, and a single reserve bank, the bank of england, but all the other independent members of the sterling area had their own currency and central bank and there was no attempt to dictate to them what their budgets should be.  there may be lessons to be learnt here in approaching the second stage of the delors programme."
56,10/25/1989,Labour,labour,Mr. Garrett,have three or more. there is a proposed bank of england code which will encourage companies to have independent directors.  hon.
57,10/26/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Redwood," nor do i think that there is a need for the secretary of state to have a role in appointing the members of the panel. it is already the position that the chairman, two deputy chairmen and one further individual are independent lay members appointed by the governor of the bank of england. the remaining member organisations represent the full range of those who have a interest in the proper market conduct of takeovers."
58,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nigel Lawson," there is, i believe, one other way in which anti-inflationary credibility might be enhanced in the eyes of the market and that is why, a year ago, i proposed to my right hon. friend the prime minister a fully worked-out scheme for the independence of the bank of england. but that would be a buttress; it would not be a substitute for what i was saying earlier."
59,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. John Butcher,"did my hon. friend hear the former chancellor say that he recommended according the bank of england similar status to that of the german bundesbank, and that the bundesbank had enjoyed constitutional independence and been both a brake on inflation and a prudent guardian of the money supply in the federal republic, thus providing the benefits that we have seen in that country? will my hon."
60,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Townend,butcher). i thought that one of the ex-chancellor's most significant statements today was his suggestion that he had advanced to the prime minister proposals to make the bank of england independent and more like the bundesbank. that may indeed be one of his great legacies: an independent bank of england would give us even less reason to join the erm and experience the discipline of the bundesbank.
61,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Townend," i hope that my right hon.  as it is, there is no framework, no rule and no discipline now governing british economic policy. we are not in the exchange rate mechanism and we are clearly not joining it; we do not have in independent central bank; and the right hon."
62,10/31/1989,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"member for blaby implied that we must have one or the other if anti-inflation policy is to be credible. it would be interesting to hear whether the study of central bank independence to which he referred has been taken any further or whether it found its way into the prime minister's or sir alan walters's wastepaper basket; and if so, for what reason. perhaps it is to be a new source of dispute."
63,10/31/1989,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"is it an unchanged commitment which will be continued by the new chancellor, or will it surge forward at some point as the issue on which he resigns when he discovers that it is the subject of tittle-tattle and unwarranted things all got up by the press?  there is no clear framework within which british economic policy operates   it is not the ems, the independent central bank, broad money or narrow money; and it is certainly not the exchange rate. if monetarism cannot be worked by the present government, i cannot conceive of any government that could make it work."
64,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Howell,"we should be under no illusions: in all that he said this afternoon, he made one comment of the utmost significance which will be central to our debates in future. he said that he had been thinking, as many of us have, about how to set up a genuinely independent central bank which would depoliticise monetary decisions. the politicisation of such decisions bedevils them, causing them to be taken on political rather than purely technical grounds."
65,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Howell," the second new thought follows from the first. if we have an independent central bank, we can begin to operate on the money supply in ways in which we have not been able to do hitherto. we set the interest rate for money and the central bank provides unlimited quantities as lender of last resort at the price of 15 per cent."
66,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Howell,"many of us wonder whether we can switch to operating on the bank's reserves   on the monetary base. in that case, the independent central bank would not set interest rates. instead, it would operate on the reserves and interest rates would fall out of the end of that."
67,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Howell,that is a stark and unreal choice on which we have paralysed and crucified ourselves.  i understand that references to independent central banks are anathema to many opposition members. they think back to 1931 when they seized control of the banking system from montagu norman and the rest.
68,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Howell," my right hon. friend the member for blaby, the former chancellor, has confirmed that the time has come for us to have an independent central bank which can operate an effective monetary policy which ensures stability of the currency upon which everything   the jobs, growth and everything else hon. members want   depends."
69,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Matthew Carrington,"friend the member for blaby (mr. lawson) said that suggestions had been made in the treasury that the bank of england should be constituted with its own charter   presumably modelled on the federal reserve in the united states   to enable it to control the money supply independent of political decisions. that has some attractions, even in isolation, but i am afraid that it is the attraction of copping out on political decisions."
70,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Matthew Carrington," it is sensible to consider that suggestion as a way of resolving the inherent problems of the erm. if the bank of england and the banque de france could have a relationship with a more moderately constituted bundesbank, so that the three central banks of the major ec currencies could operate monetary policy independent of political decisions, they could run monetary policy in such a way as to produce stability of monetary policy across the ec which would enable the erm to work. that is a fundamental change towards which we should perhaps move more rapidly than we are moving towards european monetary union."
71,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mrs. Teresa Gorman,"lawson), however, touched on one alternative: he said that he had spoken to the prime minister some time ago about the prospect of privatising, or at least making independent, the bank of england, and he presented the idea that banks should not be manipulated by politicians.  there is an alternative to our entry into the ems, with all that that might entail.  i hope that the treasury will consider renewed targeting of monetary supply."
72,10/31/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Anthony Coombs,"if an independent bank of england    as mentioned by my right hon. their concern for the health of the economy is bogus   and so is their motion, which i urge the house to reject. to be fair to herself, will the prime minister tell us why she rejected the former chancellor's proposal for an independent bank of england?"
73,11/2/1989,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith,"the chancellor is inviting the house and the country to accept an alternative proposal set out in this document, which is an invitation to a race that the bundesbank would be almost certain to win   to an independent central bank of the sort favoured by his predecessor. i am glad that the hon.  i mention two major reservations that we have about states two and three."
74,11/2/1989,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith,"let me make it clear that we would not be willing to accept any system of central banks which would be independent of political control, just as we strongly oppose an independent status for the bank of england such as the former chancellor, the right hon. member for blaby appears to have been considering a year ago and which was only tantalisingly revealed in his post-resignation comments this week. i do not know whether the present chancellor will pick up that idea and seek to persuade the rest of his colleagues   "
75,11/2/1989,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith,"in the proposed system of independent central banks there is no democratic accountability at all. the whole point of having an independent banking system, bundesbank-style, is that it is insulated from politics. he said:
 a year ago, i proposed to my right hon."
76,11/2/1989,Labour,labour,Mr. Robert Sheldon,"friend the prime minister a fully worked-out scheme for the independence of the bank of england.""    [official report, 31 october 1989; vol. 159, c. with the next general election now probably delayed at least to the autumn of 1991, and perhaps even the spring of 1992, the best time to lock ourselves into the erm would be either in the autumn of 1990   once french and italian exchange controls have been fully removed and our own inflation rate has fallen closer to that of germany    or in the first week immediately after the next general election."
77,11/2/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nigel Forman," if the latter choice seems politically preferable, it should be accompanied and supported by an unambiguous commitment in our next manifesto to establish the bank of england on a new basis of strength and independence analagous to that of the bundesbank or the federal reserve. that will give extra confidence to the markets and increase the credibility and, if necessary, the austerity of monetary policy in this country. member for blaby (mr."
78,11/2/1989,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith,"lawson), in his intervention on tuesday, about the independence of the central bank. a number of conservative members share my interest in that idea and my belief that the lack of independence of britain's central bank is a weakness in our tackling of inflation.  one of the merits of a european central banking system which enjoys some political independence is that it could provide an anti-inflationary mechanism which was not so subject to the short-term whims of politicians as elections approached."
79,11/2/1989,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith,"there is considerable merit in that.  what has happened to the medium-term financial strategy, which was always quoted in previous statements? does the chancellor now accept his predecessor's view that some stronger external discipline, such as full membership of the european monetary system or an independent central bank, is needed?"
80,11/15/1989,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith," how does the chancellor expect industry to expand on present interest rates? none of those things will do for us what we are not prepared to do for ourselves. in that context, to establish sound money, stable exchange rates and lower interest rates, we might as a government and as a nation look hard at what we could do for ourselves by restoring the independent status of the bank of england and freeing it from its current political control."
81,11/15/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Christopher Gill,"there are other and more varied ways in which we can take steps to do for ourselves   things which, i suspect, hon. today we have already heard references to what he said. he agreed with the british view that there should be a trial period of a couple of years, after all controls on capital movements were removed, before proceeding further, and that a political framework must be established before there could be a single independent european community central bank."
82,11/24/1989,Conservative,conservative,Geoffrey Finsberg,"those who criticise the british attitude towards the exchange rate mechanism always omit that proviso by mr. she is a prime minister who can brook no discipline over her conduct and control of power. she demands the freedom to devalue the currency and to print more money   the freedoms that would be restricted if we became full members of the european monetary system and had a more independent central bank, whether british or european."
83,11/28/1989,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"why does the prime minister want the freedom to devalue the currency and to print money? that may be why my right hon. friend's predecessor put forward the argument that there should be an independent bank of england, similar to the independent bundesbank, but i do not accept the whole of that argument."
84,11/28/1989,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Heath, i believe that it is still possible for the governor of the bank of england to use his influence in the city. she duly got one   for 16 june 1990.    does not the prime minister agree that it would make very good sense for britain now to organise a serious study of the constitutional and economic consequences of economic and monetary union   a study not confined to the governors of the european central banks   and at the same time to ensure that placed at the very top of the european agenda is the future relationship between the european communities and the emerging independent and democratic countries of eastern europe?
85,12/7/1989,Labour,labour,Mr. Shore," [interruption.] as it is becoming clear that the german bundesbank is keen to establish itself as a central bank for western europe, what is the policy of the government and the bank of england? is it not fair to say that the governor of the bank of england wants more independence from the treasury, and would like the bank of england to operate in a similar way to the german bundesbank?"
86,1/18/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lilley,"my hon. friend knows that we considered that idea some 18 months ago, and we concluded that it is difficult to have a constitutionally independent central bank, such as exists in the united states and west germany, within our westminster constitution because the house, on behalf of the british people, expects the government to be accountable and responsible for monetary and economic policy. the financial secretary to the treasury is intervening from a sedentary position."
87,1/23/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,the prime minister hates the idea of the government who she heads being inhibited in any way. she adopts exactly the same attitude in her opposition to the previous chancellor's proposal that there should be a more independent central bank. it was instructive to hear what the prime minister said about that.
88,1/23/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"his evidence to the select committee made it clear that he is in no way attached to monetarist theories. monetarism is out; the medium-term financial strategy is out; and the idea of an independent central bank even in britain, let alone as part of the new european model, is excluded   if not by the chancellor, very firmly by the prime minister. the ems is still a long way off."
89,3/6/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Heseltine,"but one would preserve that sense of national independence if we saw it happening coincidentally with the establishment of a central independent bank in britain.  we should suggest to our european partners that they should all establish independent central banks on the same model as the bundesbank, operating to the disciplines of the bundesbank. let us have no illusions about that: the disciplines of the bundesbank are precisely those to which we are all committed."
90,3/6/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Heseltine,"it is precisely because it has been so successful, and the deutschmark so powerful, that all of us recognise that either it will make it on its own, dominating the european economic marketplace, or there will be some arrangement within which we conduct a dialogue; in other words, we have access to the top table.  a way in which that could be achieved without loss of national sovereignty would be if an independent team of hankers, operating to the same disciplines as the bundesbank, were established in the national capitals, acting coherently as a council of central bankers.  it would be perfectly possible for any country to opt out of the exchange rate mechanism or not to attend the meeting of the council of central bankers if it wanted to."
91,3/6/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Doug Henderson,"heseltine). as the house well knows, he has been willing to criticise in the country the government's policy on the exchange rate mechanism and their disastrous regional policy, but unfortunately all that the house heard from him today were institutional points about more independence for the governor of the bank of england. but perhaps that is all we could expect from a member who, notwithstanding his criticisms in the country of the government, trooped through the conservative lobby to vote for the tax-cutting budget in 1988 which gave rise to all the present difficulties."
92,3/6/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Hogg,"perhaps my right hon. friend the member for henley will forgive my asking this question, at least rhetorically, of him: if the german central bank is indeed such a model of independence, how much independence did it have when the german government decided to amalgamate the ostmark and the deutschmark? i suspect, not that much."
93,3/21/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith,"lawson) for a more independent central bank and place it back on the prime minister's desk with a little note saying, ""please read this again."" there may be much merit in having a more autonomous judge of our monetary policy and an institutionalised battle against inflation. we will get that under european monetary union, but why not have it in the meantime by giving the bank of england greater independence?  judgments about these aspects of the budget are being made in this place and in the city, but judgments about different aspects of it are being made in ordinary homes."
94,5/1/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith, it is not surprising that with an anti-inflation policy in such a markedly unsuccessful phase there is increasing interest in the idea that we need some other framework within which to operate. it is not surprising that interest is widening in the independence and anti-inflationary role of a central bank. i still believe that the former chancellor's paper should be dug out of the wastepaper basket and published so that it could be the subject of genuine public debate.
95,5/1/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Denzil Davies," the contrast with france and germany is stark. germany has a fairly flexible governmental regulatory system but a strong independent central bank. on the other hand, france has a weak central bank   that used to be the case and i believe that it is still true because we certainly do not hear much about the banque de france   but has a strong, central and almost inflexible governmental regulatory system."
96,5/1/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Denzil Davies," therefore, while one country has an independent central bank and a looser system of government, the other has the opposite, but both are now maintaining a rate of inflation of between 3 and 3Â·5 per cent. in britain we have neither. we do not have a governmental regulatory system and, although i am not advocating an independent central bank, we have a central bank that is somewhere between the banque de france and the bundesbank."
97,5/1/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Denzil Davies,"we have neither one system nor the other.  as i have said, i do not believe that we should have a central bank that is totally independent because i do not believe that in a democratic society bankers should be allowed to control the supply of money. that is something for government."
98,5/1/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nicholas Budgen,"friend the prime minister was properly sceptical of the proposals to make the bank of england more independent. she suspected that it was part of a wider scheme to bring britain within the exchange rate mechanism and closer to a european central bank. as she rightly says, we believe in a supreme parliament with an entirely independent central bank."
99,5/1/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nicholas Budgen," i see your eagle eye upon me, mr. that is recognised by all parts of what i might pompously describe as educated opinion. in the same way, if we find, as we shall, that entering the er m does not bring a painless attack upon inflation, and if we find that it has gone exactly the same way as prices and incomes policies, the control of interest rates through reserve assets, credit controls, or all those other myths of a painless way to control inflation, we shall have to give to the bank of england greater independence within our constitution because we shall have plainly proved that, sadly, over all the years since the war democratic politicians have demonstrated that they and the british people, if in doubt, like inflation."
100,6/11/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Shore,"the hon.  since last december's strasbourg european council meeting, there have been further meetings of finance ministers to discuss two commission papers on economic and monetary union. discussions there have centred on the degree of central control over member states' budget deficits and on the independence of the proposed eurofed central bank."

102,6/11/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Robertson,"it says:
 given the effect of the single market, and britain's likely participation in the erm, closer co-operation on monetary policy between the ec countries is both inevitable and desirable. but we would oppose the proposals for an all-powerful, but unaccountable european central bank, as outlined in the delors plan for economic and monetary union   just as we would not advocate an independent bank of england. as the central banks of the ec countries gain experience of working more closely together, with britain as a full member of the erm, it may be that the need for a new institution will emerge."
103,6/15/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. John Bowis," presumably as part of wanting a european currency, the hon. gentleman would have to have a central bank and so on, but the document continued:
 we would oppose the proposals for an all-powerful, but unaccountable, european central bank, as outlined in the delors plan  ¦ we would not advocate an independent bank of england.  the speech of the hon."
104,6/15/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith,"there is no necessity why such central control should exist even if the process of monetary integration proceeds apace. secondly, we do not accept jacques delors' vision of a totally independent central bank determining, in an unelected fashion, the monetary policies of europe. we do not believe in unelected bankers exercising an independent control over the major items of economic policy."
105,6/15/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nigel Forman,"i very much doubt whether a future labour government would be able to do that. equally, i wonder whether a future labour government would accept the need for real operational and institutional independence for a central bank or a european system of central banks. it is clear not only from the quotations of my hon."
106,6/15/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nigel Forman,"friend the financial secretary to the treasury from the labour party document, but from the speech of the hon. member for islington, south and finsbury that the opposition are not enthusiastic about the idea of statutory accountability or independence of any kind for our central bank.  if the crunch came, and if we had a labour government formed by the modern new-look labour party, a labour chancellor and prime minister would fall back upon the old protectionist socialist impulses of the labour party."
107,6/15/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nigel Forman," thirdly, and importantly, there must be some institutional compatibility between the arrangements that we put in place and those emerging in other european countries. it is significant that even holland, france and spain, all of which have had central banks that were, in varying degrees, close to their ministries of finance, are now moving quite deliberately towards a more independent role for their central banks because they have learnt from the experience of the bundesbank and from the federal reserve in washingon.  fourthly, we should try to establish a more logical division of labour between national parliaments   such as ours   and the emerging european parliament, which must supervise and hold to account the activities of the commission and the council of ministers."
108,6/15/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Cash,"may i take up my hon. friend's point about the independence of the central bank? does he agree that, according to articles 3 and 12 of the basic law, although the bundesbank exercises a degree of significant independence in regard to currency stability, that independence is nevertheless subject to the overall political control of the federal government?"
109,6/15/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Forman,"pÃ¶hl, exercise the authority. the key point is the degree of independence that any central bank has, and the market perception of that independence. that is why i stress market credibility as an agreement for the course that i favour."
110,6/15/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Forman,"increasingly in the modern world the real core of power is passing from this house to    as the independent central bank has been so spectacularly successful in germany, and as a similar mechaism is now proposed for the european community, why are the government, who are anxious to counter inflation, so timid about the suggestion? it cannot be true that business is better off from paying less tax and that the tax yield is greater."
111,7/17/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"it also argues for the mechanisms to ensure stable prices which exist in those countries about which the government are having such difficulty in their public pronouncements at present. here we are lecturing herr pÃ¶hl, saying that he does not know how to handle inflation and that he would not have known how to deal with the kind of unemployment that existed in jarrow, when germany has produced a stable price regime out of its independent central banking system.  the stability in germany is the envy of british business and, in that climate, a great deal of investment is taking place."
112,7/24/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,smith) made labour's position quite clear in his response to my earlier intervention. he said that the labour party would have none of that and did not want an independent autonomous central bank. he is at one with the government in that.
113,10/15/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Alan Beith,"does he rule that out? as the prime minister's objections to joining the exchange rate mechanism before inflation was down to the level of our partners have been blown away like confetti in a gale, may we hope that her objections to a single currency and a more independent european central bank will go the same way?  as there is a strong and developing consensus in several other community countries in favour of currency union, i repeat now what i have told many colleagues in the community and in the commission for some years."
114,10/23/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Kinnock,"that community of democracies should never support the creation of a so-called independent central bank. it is no more appropriate for a democratic country or a group of democratic countries to allow monetary policy to be handed over to an independent, unaccountable bank than it would be for fiscal, public expenditure and taxation policies to be given over to such a bank. it is something which i would thoroughly endorse and welcome, but it is quite clear that it would be anathema to the leader of the opposition and members on the opposition benches who agree with his approach."
115,10/23/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lawson,stage 2 would involve the national central banks becoming independent   independent national central banks cooperating closely together. that would be the essence of stage 2. the house knows that i mentioned in my resignation speech how i had made this proposal at an earlier stage so far as the bank of england was concerned.
116,10/23/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lawson,"to suggest that independent central banks are not compatible with democracy, as the leader of the opposition did, is absolute nonsense. it is to suggest that germany is not a democracy, that the united states is not a democracy and that switzerland is not a democracy. all those three countries have independent central banks."
117,10/23/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lawson,"that is stage 2. friend is carrying on about his idea of independent central banks. whereas those banks would be independent of the political process within their member states, surely they would have to be acting together, and they would be not independent of each other but operating as a co-ordinated european bank."
118,10/23/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lawson,"friend is mistaken. they would be acting together rather in the way in which the independent central banks acted together at the time of the classical gold standard, and they co-operated very closely in that context   independent national central banks working closely together. the european central bank would also have to be independent."
119,10/23/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lawson,"there is no argument about that, except on the opposition side of the house.  the stage 2 which the right hon. gentleman has described accurately today, a stage that naturally involves independent central banks in the member countries, is even more unwelcome to the prime minister than was entry to the exchange mechanism about which he talked earlier."
120,10/23/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith,"the various views that the right hon. gentleman correctly attributed to the leader of the opposition are shared in full measure by the prime minister, who, at the dispatch box, has said that an independent central bank contravenes the democratic and parliamentary traditions of this country. yet the independent central bank is a mechanism which is proven to work in controlling inflation and which, as the right hon."
121,10/23/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith,"gentleman says, operates in democracies such as germany and the united states of america.  the government must come clean and tell us the end goal of all this. are we genuinely heading for a single currency, monetary union and an independent central bank, or are we not?"
122,10/23/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"the present signs suggest that most of those objectives are not the government's objectives. indeed, the government have set aside the obvious advantages to fighting inflation of having a rnore independent central bank because of the now wholly bogus argument about the control that parliament is supposed to be able to exercise over monetary policy. anybody who believes that the house of commons is in control of monetary policy seriously misunderstands the way in which the british system of government works."
123,10/23/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Win Griffiths,"hon. members were also worried about getting tied into a single currency, independent central banks and economic and monetary union. sovereignty is not totally independent and free standing."
124,10/23/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Win Griffiths,"britain joined the erm during the recess and immediately before the conservative party conference, and the government joined it in order to allow embarrassed cabinet ministers off the hook.  doubts were expressed about the concept of an independent central bank for europe. those are misplaced doubts because, as my hon."
125,10/23/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Win Griffiths,"if the government were to follow the policies in our amendment, we would have a much healthier and a more prosperous economy rather than the disaster for which we are heading. we have made it clear on several occasions that we do not believe in an independent central bank at a european or a national level. the monetary authority would be subject to political control, which would have to be negotiated, but it would not be, in the sense that the right hon."
126,10/23/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lamont,"and learned gentleman describes it, an independent central bank.  the right hon. one problem is that other member states apply eec directives in a leisurely and selective manner to suit their circumstances."
127,10/29/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Cryer,"the government have a new-found air of independence, and i suggest that they take the same attitude that they are taking towards a central bank and monetary union. directives are pouring out of the common market. in the light of last weekend's discussions, will my right hon."
128,10/30/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Robin Squire,"friend reconsider in the near future the proposal to separate the bank of england and make it independent so that it may serve as a buttress in this country's battle against inflation? i am grateful to the prime minister for giving way and for the assurance that she has just given about the care she will take over interest rate policy. why is she so reluctant to join the real anti-inflation club, the one that combines a single currency with an independent central bank?"
129,11/7/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"does not she realise that many of the industrialists whom she has praised see a single currency as the natural extension of free enterprise and a free market? that is the truth of the matter.  the question of sovereignty again arises with the independent, central bank."
130,11/7/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,i find something deeply offensive about the comments of the hon. what absolute nonsense.  let me remind the house that most other european democracies   most of which would bear ready comparison with ours and appear better   have independent central banks.
131,11/7/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,it is offensive to say that that is somehow inimical to the operation of a democracy. the prime minister put forward the argument that somehow or other an independent central bank undermines the sovereignty of parliament. does any hon.
132,11/7/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,"the house has been weakened to such an extent that effectively it is a poodle. by having an independent central bank we would be damaging the prime minister's sovereignty   we would be diminishing the prime minister's sovereignty to reduce interest rates on the eve of the conservative party conference for the good of her party and not for the good of the nation, and that cannot come too soon. we would be diminishing the prime minister's sovereignty over debauching the british economy before an election to purchase votes, for which we would all pay the price afterwards."
133,11/7/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,"i am surprised that he does not object to such sovereignty. to use the words of sir leon brittan   backed up by the chancellor   when he was in a similar position, an independent central bank, as has been established in germany and so many other democracies, is a solid rock upon which a genuine counter-inflationary policy can be based. the government tell us the opposite."
134,11/7/1990,Independent SDP,labour,Dr. David Owen,"first, we cannot anticipate the circumstances in which that treaty, on that date, will come into being; and, secondly, we would surrender all exchange rate control. until we can see clearly the nature of the beast in operation in phase 2, it will be hard to be certain that a system comprising central banks   or euro-fed   which will be the tighter organisation needed for those that enter a single currency, are operating independently and actually have an anti-inflationary bias. the detail is everything."
135,11/9/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lilley,"member for dunfermline, east some simple questions. first, is the labour party in favour of an independent european central bank? or do they not know?"
136,11/9/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lilley,"members: ""come on.""] would it be correct to say that the labour party is in favour of an independent central bank? i am more and more amazed."
137,11/14/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"the bundesbank takes decisions which have a very powerful impact on our economy. i would much rather be part of a central bank and monetary system which was much more influenced by our own traditions and ways because we were part of it, but i would nevertheless like it to enjoy the kind of independence that has enabled germany to have a much lower rate of inflation for so long. those who deride and disagree with that view should consider what has happened in other countries."
138,11/14/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Howell,"the right hon. gentleman is speaking with great wisdom, as he often does in economic debates, but is he not unnecessarily complicating the issue of the authority of central banks and their independence of elected governments? surely a central bank should look after monetary policy and monetary affairs, as the bundesbank does, while the elected politicians have the last say on higher matters of state   for example, the unification of germany."
139,11/14/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Howell,"when world markets look in on this country and see that, however determined are our political leaders, they are still the people who pull the precise levers of monetary policy   short-term interest rates   those markets are bound to attach less credibility to such decisions than if we had a separate, more independent monetary authority.  there can never be a completely independent authority, because a subtle nexus of relationships must exist between central bank governors and any democratically elected government. however, unless we can establish greater separation of the powers of our central monetary authorities in operating monetary policy, and remove from the shoulders of my right hon."
140,11/14/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. William Cash,"the argument about economic and monetary union will lead to the socialists squealing loudly when they realise that the charge capping arrangement that will be imposed under binding rules by the proposed central bank will cause maximum dislocation for the regions which they purport to represent most effectively in the house. also, others elsewhere in the european community will suffer, because when the paymaster, which is likely to be the german economy, finds that the poorer countries are running budget deficits, somebody will be sent over to say, ""we do not like the fact that you are spending this money,"" and then, ""you cannot spend it."" the binding rules that will be imposed by the independent, unaccountable and unelected central bankers will thus impose upon those whom opposition members purport to represent the sort of misery that will create internal divisions and jealousy within europe.  further, it is part of the arguments that i have heard from some members of my own party and from others elsewhere that we should have a hard-core federal system which should exclude those very people in eastern europe who most need investment to enable them to attach to the growth in their countries the democracy so hard won over the past couple of years."
141,11/15/1990,Labour,labour,Dr. Marek," there is a world of difference between a central bank under the political control of one nation state and its government, and a central bank that is under the political control of 12 nation states, and therefore 12 finance ministers. there is also a difference between a central bank modelled on the lines of the bundesbank and a bank which is truly independent of political control. i shall not say which i prefer."
142,11/15/1990,Labour,labour,Dr. Marek,that is the difference. will the prime minister tell us whether she intends to continue her personal fight against a single currency and an independent central bank when she leaves office? will my right hon.
143,12/6/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,"and learned friend report to the governor of the bank of england that there is growing support throughout the house for greater independence for the bank and that those arguments exist independent of whether there is any sort of monetary union? on the face of it, the new prime minister seems to be maintaining the uncompromising attitude displayed by his predecessor.  in the rewarding interview that he gave to mr."
144,12/6/1990,Labour,labour,Mr. Kaufman,"walden, the new prime minister himself posed the question:
 could we accept an independent, non-elected central bank with external control over our domestic monetary situation? i believe that we can look our european partners in the face and live with it. a great help towards moving to a common currency would be the introduction of an independent central bank."
145,12/6/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Ray Whitney,"it is significant that almost the first act of the attlee government after 1945 was the nationalisation of the bank of england.  as the warsaw pact disappears, perhaps we should pause and ask ourselves whether large blocs of any kind are still such a good idea. i do not intend to enter the complex debate about economic and monetary union and an independent european central bank because time does not permit."
146,12/6/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Michael Lord,"however, i find it quite frightening, bearing in mind that all these proposed measures are of such huge proportions and have never been tried before, that so many people who are for or against, and especially those who are in favour, can be so sure of the outcome. only two nights ago, i had dinner with a most distinguished german journalist. he said, ""for heaven's sake, make sure that this doesn't go through."" he has written articles about this, and he knows that the reality is that, if germany were to obtain the degree of control over europe that would be the consequence of the proposed independent central bank, it would not be in the interests of germany or europe, and it would certainly not be in the interests of the united kingdom."
147,12/6/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Cash," i shall say no more about the farce of the european conference that i attended, where serious questions were raised about matters of consent. that is because it begs the central question. once one has arrived at the point of assuming that the higher tier   of which the independent central bank is to be the highest tier in terms of economic and monetary policy   is to be conceded, there is no need for subsidiarity."
148,12/6/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Cash,"it eats itself up like monty python. there can be no objection if such developments put money into their pockets, give them freedom of choice, and encourage a greater propensity to save than to spend. if from that we can develop statutes for an independent central bank and provide our currency with stability for the future, that would be another great step forward."
149,12/6/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Anthony Nelson,"the bank of england already enjoys a high degree of independence, and the proposals for it to play a part within a european central banking mechanism would give it greater strength rather than less autonomy.  if britain emerged from the intergovernmental conference having either vetoed the reasonable proposals which have already been made, or with a form of twin-track approach to europe which would put us in a siding rather than in the slow lane, that would not reflect the tide of events or the interests of our constituents. i do not believe that the european proposals would lead to anything like that."
150,12/6/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Patrick Ground,there is no such thing as a truly independent central bank. the bundesbank was shown not to be entirely independent when faced with the prospect of the reunification of germany. there would still be national banks acting on behalf of the central bank.
151,12/6/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Patrick Ground,"there is no great difference in kind between the governor of a central bank which has a relatively independent character and a collection of independent governors appointed by national governments. there may be a difference, but it is not completely different in character from the position in the united states and western germany. it was an interesting experience to participate in last week's negotiations."
152,12/10/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lilley,"it is hard to believe that those who are so reluctant to concede sovereignty on a matter which, in principle, has been within the community's competence for the past two or three decades would be willing to hand over monetary policy to a truly independent central bank. not surprisingly, the right hon.  i also hear arguments   not least from some of my hon."
153,12/12/1990,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lamont,"friends   about the potential benefits that could come from an independent central bank or an independent monetary policy. whatever the pros and cons of that argument, it has to be recognised that we have already in some measure achieved the benefits of that by joining an anti-inflationary club that has a track record, credibility and clear rules. friend the chancellor, who appears to be in sympathy with the bruges group."
154,12/12/1990,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"he will also have to face attacks from conservative members who do not want to have anything to do with a single currency or central bank independence. they want none of it.  whether or not the proposal for a hard ecu would ever work, it does not face up to what i believe to be the key issue in the whole debate about monetary union: what form of accountability should exist for community financial institutions."
155,1/24/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith,"i think that a majority of the house, with some exceptions, is agreed that a completely independent european central bank would not be acceptable. in the opinion of the majority, there has to be some form of political accountability. in a previous debate i asked the chancellor, who was then chief secretary, to explain the arrangements for its accountability, and he appeared to have some difficulty in doing so."
156,1/24/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith,"he told me that the government were against an independent central bank, which is fine, and that
 the monetary authority would be subject to political control, which would have to be negotiated"".    [official report, 23 october 1990; vol.  for those reasons we do not think that the hard ecu adequately tackles what we consider to be a crucial matter."
157,1/24/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith,"nor, for that matter, do we think that the present commission proposals, which envisage a basically independent central banking system, are satisfactory. we believe that there needs to be established a relationship of accountability between any central bank and the elected governments of member states. gentleman made that point."
158,1/24/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith,"i understood his party's policy to be that it was not specifically in favour of having an independent bank of england and, even more so, an independent european central bank. however, he was quite right to draw attention to the fact that the bundesbank is not totally independent. secondly, there is strong evidence to suggest that it would lower inflation."
159,1/24/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Russell Johnston,"certainly the creation of a central bank would lead to a degree of credibility if it was like the bundesbank, which is not absolutely independent but has an important area of independence. because they can rely upon the position of the central bank and know that inflation will not rise, employers and employees restrain wages. sometimes politicians can go wrong because, as the time approaches to go to the polls, they are tempted to change things and make them a little better."
160,1/24/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Russell Johnston," thirdly, experience in germany, and for that matter in the united states, of an independent central bank is good. there is often tension between the elected government and the bankers, as there was recently in germany, hut. the key problem is that the hard ecu scheme would not do what most other ems countries want."
161,1/24/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. John Battle,"the government's latest proposals on the hard ecu concede the concept of an independent central bank but do not address the key issue of who will make key decisions on monetary policy. even if the hard ecu worked, there would still be a strong possibility that an unreconstructed bundesbank would remain firmly in charge. we insist that it should be."
162,1/24/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. John Battle,the government are struggling to remain on the fence on the independence of the european monetary fund or central bank system. in practice the government are voting for continued control by the bundesbank.  should we go along some of the routes suggested in the delors report?
163,1/24/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. John Butterfill,"for example, should we have independent central banks within the community? greater independence for central banks has a good deal to commend it. it would impose disciplines upon the management of the economy which are desirable and in accordance with conservative thinking."
164,1/24/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nigel Forman, the combination of legal accountability to the european court of justice and political accountability to the european parliament is the right one for the european monetary fund. it is then up to this house rather than the government of the day to provide a statutory framework of accountability for a much more independent bank of england.  i believe that the house should welcome these proposals rather than take fright at them.
165,2/13/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Peter Shore,"member for berwick-upon-tweed (mr. beith) were both so concerned about it that they suggested that we invent a new way of ordering our affairs, enabling an independently reconstructed bank of england to make all the necessary decisions on our behalf.  even if i accepted that inflation was the outstanding problem of today, i should find that suggestion rather naive."
166,2/19/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Charles Wardle,"however, there is no point in jobbing backwards. manufacturers might be helped if an independent bank of england were to assume control of exchange rate policy at a full arm's length from politicians of all parties. the sterling-dollar exchange rate undoubtedly still puts british industry in a seriously uncompetitive position, but that will not change overnight either."
167,2/20/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Merlyn Rees,"it is no respecter of political parties.  in economic circles, the argument is that the bank of england should be independent because the politicians do not get economic analysis right, so if we extend that argument, it would be better to leave it to somebody else to decide on crime because the politicians have not been good on law and order. it would be as well for the hon."
168,2/20/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Janman,"gentleman said strengthens my case. he was right when he talked about whether we should have an independent bank of england. he implied that over a 30 to 40-year period both parties in government have been unable to sustain not an overtight, but a disciplined monetary policy, although there are fine examples over a short period where that did not happen, such as in 1969 when the labour government had a balanced budget."
169,3/20/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith," that is all well and good, and the chancellor has made a reasonable attempt in the budget to demonstrate that fiscal responsibility and that commitment. but they could have been achieved more clearly and over a longer period by announcing the measure that we proposed, of greater independence for the central bank on monetary policy. that would have removed the need for the premium on interest rates which arises from uncertainty about the government's attitude to monetary policy and the level of sterling."
170,3/20/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Maude,beith). the main burden of his song seemed to be that we should hand over control of monetary policy to an independent central bank. that demonstrates in an aspirant chancellor of the exchequer a certain lack of confidence in his ability to control monetary policy.
171,3/20/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Maude,"if there were ever the prospect of his being chancellor of the exchequer, the attractions of having an independent central bank might become rather more apparent. i am sure that the hon. on wednesday, my hon."
172,3/25/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Wallace,"friend the member for berwick-upon-tweed stated how our party would ensure that interest rates not only came down, but were kept down through movement into the narrower band of the exchange rate mechanism and greater independence for the central bank.  we should not,however, lose sight of the fact that many businesses have already gone to the wall. they are now seeking to discipline employees by threatening them with a fixed and unalterable exchange rate."
173,4/30/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Robert Sheldon,"as if that were not enough, some people are producing the bogey of an independent bank of england.  i am not against fixed exchange rates. he took what i can only describe as a holding position."
174,4/30/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith," the chairman of the treasury and civil service select committee put the remarks of the governor to the chancellor, who responded to the governor's view that a more independent role for the central bank would help in the battle against inflation by saying that countries differ in their practices in that respect. some countries, he said, use a more independent central bank while others do not. some have found that helpful in fighting inflation while others do not appear to need it."
175,4/30/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"i suspect that there may be a rethink in the treasury which has not been communicated to the secretary of state for employment, who does not seem to get on very well with the treasury anyway. he was not very successful in getting a decent training programme out of the treasury, so it would not be surprising if the treasury had not told him about its thinking with regard to central bank independence.  it is striking that inflation is always reduced in advance of an election and that is clear if we consider the statistics over several years."
176,5/15/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen," may i say a few words about what the popular papers describe as a dispute between the governor of the bank of england and the chancellor of the exchequer about reducing interest rates? i am one of those who would wish greater independence to be exercised by the governor of the bank of england, but not because i want this country to go into any form of euro-bank.  i want this country to return to a freely floating exchange rate."
177,6/13/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Carlile,that makes no sense at all. the government strongly underestimated the confidence that the creation of an independent central bank would engender alongside the acceptance of a common currency for europe.  the government must act.
178,6/26/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"gentleman. could he find a moment to say whether he is in favour of a single currency and whether he believes that a european central bank should enjoy independence in its responsibility for price stability? it is not that i do not like to give way, but time is pressing and i do not wish to give way too often."
179,6/26/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Russell Johnston,"secondly, monetary union will give the british economy the balance of a sustained counter-inflation policy that it has long been denied. we are not only not afraid of an independent central bank   the labour front bench indisputably is    but we welcome it. we should be only too pleased to follow the example of the bundesbank model because it works."
180,6/26/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Robertson," he went on to say that they believed in the development of a common foreign and security policy within europe. he then stated that he and his colleagues believed in
 the establishment of an economic and monetary union with an independent european central banking system and the ultimate goal of a single currency.  that application came not with the imprimatur of an obscure member of the european parliament, but in the name of the chairman of the conservative party and the prime minister."
181,7/3/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Wallace,"friend the member for yeovil (mr. ashdown), there is a move to enter the narrow currency band and to make the bank of england independent   investors, companies and employees will know that the government mean business. once that is understood we shall be able to embark on a path of sustainable growth, with greater economic stability, and to generate circumstances in which unemployment can not only fall but, with any luck, remain at a lower level."
182,7/19/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lamont,"in considering the conclusions of that report, it was the bank's view that the bank should be closed down. that is a matter for the bank of england and it is a judgment that no doubt the independent inquiry will also want to examine.  as for the dates, and when i and my right hon."
183,7/22/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Knowles,"that is right. the bank of england is not an independent central bank like those in germany and the united states. in the banking act 1987, the house deliberately give it great powers of independence."
184,7/24/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith,"if we are to ensure that interest rates and interest rate policy are used as a defence against inflation, it is important that decisions are taken by a body that makes price stability its priority. that is why we argue for a more independent central bank.  is not it intriguing that over the past couple of days the government have suddenly discovered the merits of central bank independence and that they are at pains to stress what value there is in the central bank being an independent body?"
185,7/24/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith,"of course, they are considering its role in relation to banking supervision rather than in relation to monetary policy. as i understand the policy of the hon. and learned gentleman's party, it is to hand over responsibility for these matters to another quarter altogether   to an independent european central bank."
186,10/16/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Howard,what recourse would the house have in respect of high interest rates if such an authority decided that high interest rates were necessary? the whole range of our policies answers his question. an independent central bank is part of it.
187,10/16/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Carlile,"bringing sterling into the narrow bands of the exchange rate mechanism is another part. indeed, it now imposes conditions on the running of european monetary union that are totally irresponsible. without an independent central bank we cannot have that central rock upon which a firm anti-inflationary european economic policy must be based."
188,10/31/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown," the government say that they are not prepared to propose solutions on europe that are unacceptable to the house.  we need a new government and a new system of government, and the queen's speech should have introduced such a proposal. we wanted the queen's speech to give us a new direction for our country, and an independent central bank established to run the british economy."
189,10/31/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,"i can understand why conservative and labour members do not want that. they want to continue to be able to debauch our national economy to buy votes before an election, and make british people and british industry pay the price later in jobs and lost industry. i believe that an independent central bank will come: the previous chancellor of the exchequer argued for it, and i believe that it is necessary as the rock on which to build a decent, strong, anti-inflationary policy."
190,10/31/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown," the queen's speech should have portrayed a series of policies that were much tougher on competition, particularly in relation to the utilities. we need an economy that is dedicated to price stability.  the most effective proven mechanism to achieve price stability is an independent central bank dedicated to that objective."
191,11/7/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith,"i still wonder what happened to the paper produced by the right hon. member for blaby may not like the idea of a european central bank, but he is clearly on record as saying that he believes that in this country's economy an independent central bank would be a guarantee against inflation. indeed, it would have done some good to have one when he was chancellor of the exchequer, as it would have made a significant difference to some of the measures that he took, which stoked the fires of inflation."
192,11/7/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith," the labour party has had similar problems and has gone a step further. labour front-bench members seem to have committed themselves to a single currency despite the fact that some of their back-bench supporters continue strongly to oppose it, although they are having difficulty with the question whether a european central bank would be independent. their recent policy statement will cause some heart searching on the part of the hon."
193,11/7/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Robert Sheldon,"often, control has not been exercised. there must be day-to-day independence in the running of the bank of england, but that can lead to much wider independence and to the problems that every chancellor of the exchequer has had. that is why we nationalised the bank of england; and many tories agreed because of their direct experiences."
194,11/7/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Robert Sheldon," in future, we will not just give the bank of england independence; we will transfer that independence to others in other countries and rely on ecofin. what is that? i do not want to speak too much about that matter; i simply marvel at one aspect of the opposition stance."
195,11/7/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Howell,"i understand the traditional position of the labour party and the labour movement   that the idea of a central bank, the bank of england, being totally independent is anathema to them. for reasons dating back to their folk memory of the 1930s, they strongly believe that the bank should remain under tight political control.  the labour party holds those views sincerely, and has done so for most of the 20th century."
196,11/7/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Howell,"yet those two views are removed and totally undermined by its commitment to european monetary union and the draft dutch treaty, which demands not only that the european central bank be totally independent, but that it includes central bank governors from completely independent banks and lays down all sorts of ferocious penalties for any deviation in budget deficits. such are the wonders of the opposition stance. sheldon) on europe have not always been similar to mine, i was pleased to hear him say that he could not see how it was possible for 12 finance ministers in ecofin   about which we hear a great deal these days   to control a european central bank established on the model set out in the present draft treaty prepared by the dutch government."
197,11/7/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Denzil Davies (Lianelli)," if we sign that treaty or accept its principle, that european central bank will be totally independent. it will be more independent than the bundesbank, because no government will be able to control it.  in addition, the european central bank is forbidden to take instructions from any organisation."
198,11/7/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Shore,"the community or the national states sign a pledge that they will not seek to instruct, to govern or to erode the independence of the european central bank. what does that leave? however, the difference is that no one will know whom to blame; no one will know how to get rid of them."
199,11/20/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Cash,"the central bank is to have complete independence. if it makes decisions which are inherently wrong, what will happen? rowlands) referred to eastern europe."
200,11/20/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nicholas Ridley,"it cannot be right to say that we will build this tight, centrally controlled structure with what is really a common economic policy, run centrally from brussels through the economic and finance council and through the independent central bank, and to expect the poles, the hungarians, the latvians and who knows who else, to be able suddenly to put their currencies into that system. that would delay by decades the time when we can welcome them on board. of course, the opposite part cannot control the part to which it is opposite."
201,11/20/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Denzil Davies, we shall have a european central bank which is far more independent than even the bundesbank. at least the bundesbank has a government breathing down its neck. we must be clear that that is the choice facing us.
202,11/21/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lawson," the idea that we can have an independent european central bank alone, which would be far and away the most powerful institution in the community with no accountability to anybody, is absolutely bizarre and democratically unacceptable. one of the extraordinary oddities   i put it no stronger than that   of the opposition's position is that, with the enthusiasm of the convert, they have embraced the single currency and an independent european central bank, but they will not tolerate an independent bank of england. that is a very strange position for any party, even the labour party, to adopt."
203,11/21/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lawson,"germany is aware that such convergence conditions, or something very much like them, are absolutely essential.  i could support stage 2, with the independent national central banks co-operating together, as the germans would like to see, under the committee of central bank governors, renamed the european monetary institute. that would be perfectly acceptable, but as a stopping point."
204,11/21/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lamont,"members   for example, my hon. friend the member for stafford   have pointed out that the european central bank would operate independently of political control. however, it would be accountable for its actions to the council of economic finance ministers and the president of that council would be able to attend meetings of the governing board."
205,11/29/1991,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Livsey," those improvements depend on a successful macroeconomic policy and the way in which that is run by the government and the european community with which we are now closely connected. we need firm anti-inflationary policies, which would be better achieved through an independent central bank. we need much more investment in education and training and a much more effective competition policy, particularly in those industries that have recently been privatised, such as british telecom, and the gas and electricity industries, where there should be real competition, not misuse of monopolistic powers."
206,12/18/1991,Conservative,conservative,The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Norman Lamont),"gentleman has said that he does not like the arrangements for the central bank: it is too powerful, too independent and he does not like it. if that is his view, why is he prepared to say now that so long as convergence is achieved   that is what he is saying   he will give the commitment now irreversibly to join a single currency?  secondly, on the european central bank, we have repeatedly proposed   as the right hon."
207,12/18/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Kinnock,"gentleman may have heard, some of his colleagues in the community support our proposal   a relationship between ecofin   the representative body   and the independent central bank closely modelled on the german system that has developed with such success. indeed, we want to bring the proposals that are before the community now closer to that german system.  i strongly welcome the text that was negotiated at maastricht on the european system of central banks in stage 2 and the european bank in stage 3."
208,12/18/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Forman,"article 2 stresses the primary objective of price stability and article 7 enshrines the guaranteed independence of the european central bank. the full benefits of price stability and statutory independence for the european central bank, and indeed for the bank of england   that must be a necessary institutional corollary   will be enjoyed only if a future government and parliament agree in good time to adopt a single european currency. in today's european capital markets, the freedom of exchange rates, to which some of my hon."
209,12/18/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Robert Sheldon,even tories voted for it.  those people who call for independence must ask themselves why the measure to nationalise the bank of england gained such acceptance. those who look to the bundesbank as a model for britain and the community must ask themselves how it makes its decisions.
210,12/18/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Robert Sheldon,"so when we consider such matters   creating research teams and design offices we   must remember that it was german industry rather than the bank which produced the miracle.  people who call for an independent central bank and for a eurobank must look to a future in which it might have to deal not merely with a recession like the one that we have just experienced, but with slump and depression. we must not assume that we have finally eliminated all those problems which occurred so often in previous decades and centuries."
211,12/18/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Shore,"the effects of that could be very serious from 1 january 1994.  as for the independence of the central bank and the hope of greater powers that would be given to the ecofin council, on which many of my hon. friends have placed so much importance, nothing has changed."
212,12/18/1991,Labour,labour,Mr. Shore,"the only power that ecofin has is to decide the exchange rate of the ecu against non-european currencies. beyond that, the european central bank remains wholly independent of democratic control. as my right hon."
213,12/18/1991,Conservative,conservative,Mr. James Paice,"i f those people do not have the skills or the ability, this country is sunk, whether we are part of the community or not.  the sooner that we realise that the major advances of the past 12 years have been made because we have accepted that politicians are not good at running things   then perhaps we shall see the odd man out   and the sooner that the bank of england is made independent, the better. that would be a useful major staging post towards the goal of a central european bank."
214,12/19/1991,Conservative,conservative,Geoffrey Howe,"the form of emu that has emerged from maastricht bears the important imprint of united kingdom priorities in a number of key respects. making common cause, as we have, with bonn and frankfurt and thus forging a powerful alliance, we have ensured that full emu will be open only to countries that meet strict convergence criteria, that monetary policy will be transferred only in stage 3, that price stability will be the overriding objective of the system, that the european central bank will be politically independent of all outside control, that there will be no ec-wide macro policy administered by what the french called a european economic government.  on all those points, emu is clearly a project of anglo-german design."
215,1/22/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Terence L. Higgins,the rise in interest rates in germany did not help. that may be a warning against the dangers of an independent central bank. it would be very dangerous if we were to listen to those who say that we ought to withdraw from the exchange rate mechanism.
216,1/22/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith," we need long-term anti-inflation policies. we believe that an independent central bank is the right mechanism for that and that, in the end, we shall have it because of the development of a european central bank and a single currency. the question is, how long will the united kingdom wait to get fully involved in that process?"
217,2/6/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Carlile,"they still exercise some influence, but they do not make the decisions. the independence of the german central bank, which is not immune to political influence, provides a guarantee of confidence in the german economy.  why did the government choose, when the time was right, to ignore the good sense of going into the narrow bands of the exchange rate mechanism?"
218,2/6/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Whitney," the next step forward   we must be positive, because we can expect nothing positive from the opposition   must involve creating confidence. as many independent commentators, from the governor of the bank of england downwards, agree, the basic work has been done and the right conditions set. we must now continue to build up confidence so that the savings that people are now accumulating will result in a demand-led recovery."
219,2/19/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith, the other great weakness of labour's position so far is that it lacks the anti-inflation policy which is necessary to accompany the investment measures set out in the motion. that is why we sought to amend the motion by adding the anti-inflation buttress which we believe would best be provided by an independent central bank. it is a mistaken charge for the government to lay against the labour party that its proposals would deepen recession.
220,2/19/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith," i noted that the secretary of state quoted the bundesbank a lot. i was interested to hear the deputy president of the bundesbank calling on britain yesterday to speed up moves to create an independent central bank to
 ensure adequate prior familiarisation with the new structures of decision making"".  he was warning the british government that they should understand their commitment that if they go into the monetary system they will accept an independent central bank."
221,2/19/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"alongside that, there must be a genuine commitment to free enterprise and to a free market economy. does the right hon. and learned gentleman hope that, by that time, the united kingdom will be a member of a single currency union   recovery may well take that long   and that it will then be controlled by an independent european central bank?"
222,2/26/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith," if that record is ever to improve, britain must adopt a long-term policy to deal with inflation. our advocacy of an independent central bank, committed to price stability, is the only such policy that is on offer to the british people. i have rarely heard a more compelling demonstration of the case for an independent central bank than that provided by the evasiveness shown today by hon."
223,2/26/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"member for derby, south. i should be much happier if i knew that the central bank would decide interest rate policy on the basis of price stability and maintaining sterling's position, and that future ministers in any party would have nothing to do with that decision   that they would get on with the job of managing fiscal policy and providing the infrastructure that the economy requires.  if control of interest rates were taken out of the hands of politicians and given to an independent central bank, the fight against inflation would be continued all the time, and the problem of governments going soft on inflation    particularly in the run-up to general elections   would be avoided."
224,2/26/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"greater stability of prices, interest rates and economic growth would result. recent studies have concluded that countries with independent central banks typically enjoy lower inflation, irrespective of their political make-up and budgetary policies; and there is no cost in terms of lower growth. it is certainly not irresponsible to invest in the economy now, as we suggest."
225,2/26/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"on the whole, people with no money to spend will spend more of what they subsequently gain by way of increases in pensions and benefits.  the absence of any coherent alternative suggests that no one can produce a better method of building in a firm anti-inflation policy than central bank independence. already, the government are becoming complacent about their inflation policy."
226,2/26/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith," having read the motion and the amendment, we find that we are left with the only coherent alternative   an alternative that we shall probably use in the end in any event. the government have given us to understand that, if we joined the european monetary system and a single currency were introduced, that currency would have to be operated by an independent central bank. the chancellor has been quite clear about that."
227,2/26/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"199, c. 517.]
 clearly, the chancellor has accepted that a european single currency could not be run without an independent central bank. why should we not enjoy that advantage now?"
228,2/26/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"why should we not say, here and now, that the central bank would exercise independent responsibility for monetary policy, having price stability as its objective?  that would be a much better position to adopt for an opposition party entering an election. it would be helpful if people knew that, during an election campaign and subsequently, a central bank would exercise that independent responsibility."
229,2/26/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"the government might do the country a service. if they are so worried about the consequences of other parties' coming into office, why do they not build that in now as part of a firm, permanent anti-inflation policy? surely there is a difference between an independent central bank that is running a single currency   i do not think that there is any practical alternative to that   and the government of the day continuing to be responsible to the house of commons for monetary policy when running their own currency."
230,2/26/1992,Conservative,conservative,The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. John Maples),"i follow the hon. gentleman's argument about the independent central bank; indeed, some examples, such as the bundesbank, work extremely well. does he not agree, however, that some non-independent central banks   such as those in japan and france   seem to work equally well?"
231,2/26/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"japan's central bank has gradually increased its independence from government, and that has contributed to japan's control of inflation. let us take the example of countries that simply have more independent central banks than we have. the united states federal reserve, for instance, is not an independent central bank in the full sense of the term, but it has still been able to produce a better inflation record   even with its high public-sector deficits   than we have managed in this country."
232,2/26/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"generally, the record seems favourable. competition is crucial to keeping prices down. at the end of the day, however, the only firm and reliable anchor is an independent central bank, and we shall continue to advocate it until, eventually, the country gets it."
233,3/11/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"if i was tammany hall boss and i wanted to engage someone to bribe the voters, i would not engage the chancellor of the exchequer because he is not very good at it although he thinks that he is.  investment is best made when the construction industry is in its weakest condition   that is how one gets the most favourable prices for repairing schools and hospitals and for railway construction and work on rolling stock   not when the economy starts to heat up, which is when public expenditure has to be reined in because at that point the economy may begin to overheat and generate inflation.  we need a programme of investment in an economy that is firmly anchored with a proper anti-inflation policy, including an independent central bank, a proper commitment to europe and entry into the single currency, a real commitment to free enterprise and the promotion of competition   not the rigged market of massive privatised monopolies that the government have created   a government stimulus to research and development in industry, a savings target to ensure that we rein in public expenditure when its effect would be damaging, and social justice in the tax and benefits system."
234,3/11/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"neither the voters nor i will take promises or lectures about lower taxation from the government who gave us the poll tax and who increased vat to 17Â·5 per cent. if all that pain is not to be wasted, we need policies for sustained low inflation and stable low interest rates. that requires three actions: first, and most immediately, a move to the narrow band of the european monetary system; secondly, a commitment to establish the operational independence of the bank of england; and, thirdly, ditching the unnecessary and damaging opt-out clause on our entry into the european monetary union."
235,5/6/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,i see no commitment to any of those actions in the government's programme.  the single currency is the written-in objective of the maastricht treaty. it is even worse when one considers that we are not only setting up an entirely new set of bodies to manage the currency but giving its control to a central bank mechanism which is independent of politicians and the people who represent society.
236,5/6/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Spicer,"therefore, there is a double whammy, to use the phrase which loomed large in the general election.  we all know that the bank of england, as with all central banks, has to be denationalised before the decision to set up and join in a european central bank becomes effective. denationalisation would clearly mean greater independence for the bank of england."
237,5/13/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tim Renton,"i am not saying that this should happen because i believe that all its decisions and views are necessarily and invariably wise. that was clearly not so in the case of the bank of credit and commerce international. however, it is good sense to have some years of experience of an independent domestic central bank before taking the final decision on the european central bank."
238,5/13/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tim Renton,"this would not be a bad learning curve for us politicians, nor for our bankers.  i found myself in unusual agreement with much of the earlier part of the right hon. gentleman's speech when he referred to the independence of the central bank, the narrow bands of the exchange rate mechanism and the benefits of the erm."
239,5/13/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith,"i have reservations about the latter part of his speech on the national lottery, partly because i am convinced that it cannot be made to work unless it is, in effect, a nationalised lottery   that is, a nationally-sponsored lottery that enjoys privileges denied to other raisers of charitable funds by means of lotteries. member for mid-sussex referred if they are to meet it. central bank independence is one of those things."
240,5/13/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith, there are other interesting changes of phrase. there is the long-term anti-inflation policy. i do not believe that we shall have a satisfactory long-term anti-inflation policy unless there is a combination of an independent central bank and the narrow bands of the exchange rate mechanism.
241,5/13/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"that is the way to ensure that in the longer term we have lower interest rates. member for great grimsby is around     so vocal and so active    the markets may be right to believe that one day the currency may be devalued. amendment proposed, at the end of the question, to add:but humbly regret that the gracious speech fails to provide for the essential investment in education and training which is vital to the country's economic recovery, lacks the basis for a sustained policy of low inflation and stable interest rates, and specifically lacks a commitment to joining the narrow band of the erm and establishing the operational independence of the bank of england, fails to address the fundamental problems of the economy, by increasing investment, competition and the establishment of a flexible labour market in which employees increasingly share in the success of' their companies, and does not contain legislation to deal with the problems of environmental pollution; and finally regret the absence of any legislation to provide for electoral reform for local, westminster and european elections or to provide for parliaments for scotland and wales.""    [mr."
243,5/20/1992,Labour,labour,Mr. Enright,"i have not known that bank to be so very independent of the policy pursued by west germany. i certainly have not noticed its being subservient or subject to labour governments, and from time to time it has taken action that has proved awkward even for conservative chancellors.  i cannot see that, under the present system, our bank is anything other than independent   and, in practical terms, the bundesbank has been less independent than the bank of england."
244,5/20/1992,Labour,labour,Mr. Enright,"the bundesbank made it patently clear what it thought about union between the east german mark and the west german mark: it was against it. i do not share delors's vision that decisions affecting the community in which i live in blaenau gwent increasingly should be made by bankers who are neither elected by nor accountable to our people. however, that is what an independent central bank is all about."
245,5/20/1992,Labour,labour,Mr. Llew Smith,"the powers of those bankers would make it almost impossible for a future labour government to begin to respond to the problems in our communities   the bad housing, mass unemployment, and education and health services increasingly under attack.  a central objective of the labour party has always been to put the power of money at the disposal of the people   surely that is what we are about   and to place popular control over economic forces and the power of money. yet through the treaty we will hand back that independence to the central banks   to monetary power."
246,5/20/1992,Labour,labour,Mr. Mitchell," socialism is about using the power of money for the people, about stimulating growth. nevertheless, we are still told that someone, somewhere, is impinging on our national sovereignty.  there is talk also of the effect that an independent central bank would have on europe."
247,5/20/1992,Labour,labour,Mr. Bell,"at present, as we all know, we are entirely dependent on the bundesbank. even an 0-level or a-level economics student would surely know that. the central bank is to be even more independent than the bundesbank."
248,5/21/1992,Labour,labour,Mr. Ron Leighton,"at least the bundesbank has a government breathing down its neck, as we saw with reunification.  perhaps the most important potential advantage that could be held out for a european currency is low inflation. an independent european central bank could be a powerful anti-inflationary force across the whole of europe."
249,5/21/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lamont,"for the reasons i have given, it is the government's view that a decision of such crucial political importance cannot be prejudged now, rubber-stamped and simply left to some automatic judgment and something called ""convergence criteria"". members: ""unelected.""] indeed, but many countries in europe and throughout the world have already made such arrangements with their national central banks, and i have often heard hon. members on both sides of the house argue for an independent central bank even without a commitment to a european currency."
250,5/21/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lamont,"these are profound issues, and it was awareness of them that dictated our objectives at maastricht.  i hope that during the next six months sterling will come into the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism. perhaps in the autumn a white paper will be presented on an independent bank of england, and perhaps the single market will be completed to benefit this country, as well as our trading compatriots and competitors."
251,7/2/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Kennedy," the maastricht treaty is positive in that it establishes the basis of a common citizenship across europe.  the provisions on economic and monetary union are not so clear cut as many people seem to think. the central bankers would be unelected, independent and unaccount-able, all in the name of price stability."
252,7/2/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Cash,"we can and should achieve price stability for ourselves in co-operation with our european partners, but no more than that. there are severe risks with that extreme solution, and i know that the secretary of state and the government have not accepted it either.  alternatively, if we reversed our policy of opting out of emu, if we moved sterling into the narrow bands, and if we gave the bank of england independent control over interest rates, interest rates would not only be likely to come down to give us the competitiveness that we need and industry the boost of additional resources that it currently does not have, but it would bolster the credibility of anti-inflation policy at the same time."
253,7/6/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Simon Hughes,"it is interesting that the london business school has recently come around to that view as well. it is the same trend that yesterday produced redundancies at british aerospace, followed today by further tragic redundancies at ford and rolls-royce.  the markets were commenting not on a short-term phenomenon that arose only last week, but on this country's long-term economic management, and the government's failure to establish an independent central bank and their short-term economic fumbling and mismanagement last week."
254,9/24/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown," the markets were commenting when they acted last week not on some short-term scenario but on the uncertainties surrounding britain's long-term intentions   as to whether we will be part of european monetary union or outside it. friend's other two propositions. he suggested that a clear statement be made about our intention to establish an independent central bank, and that we should immediately take steps in that direction."
255,9/24/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,"that would have reassured the market. gentleman again excludes, presumably deliberately, the other points that we made. of course we said that we ought to seek to hold the value of the pound, but we also said that other steps should be taken to increase the underlying strength of the british economy by beginning to invest and moving towards an independent central bank."
256,9/24/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown," we now pay the price for those long years of government mismanagement   for the wrong policies and decisions taken at the wrong time.  the government could have taken three actions to avoid the consequences of last wednesday's debacle. first, they could have established in britain that which every other modern economy has   an independent central bank that is mandated to maintain and to sustain price stability."
257,9/24/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,"i must make progress, but i shall be happy to respond to the hon. very well: let them prove it. let them give independent status to the bank of england, and mandate it to maintain and to sustain price stability in this country."
258,9/24/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,"if the government will do that, people will begin to believe in their capacity to stick to their undertakings. member for yeovil (mr. ashdown) argued that we might have been better able to withstand last week's pressure on sterling if we had had an independent central bank and the house did not have the right to determine whether britain joins a single currency."
259,9/24/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. John Watts,he did not describe any measures that were not already available to the bank of england last week. friend the chancellor was not reluctant to sanction massive intervention in the markets or substantial increases in interest rates to protect the parity of the pound. there were no other measures that an independent bank of england could have taken.
260,9/24/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Higgins,"i take no account of the silly little cut in interest rates that it made a few days ago; that, in my view, was intended merely as an insult.  i very much doubt whether it is possible to run an exchange rate mechanism over a broader range of countries than the narrow range of countries around germany while an independent central bank is operating in germany. this raises difficult questions."
261,9/24/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Higgins,"i certainly do not go along with those who argue that we should have an independent central bank here, for the reasons given by my hon. friend the member for slough (mr. watts): in my view, the governor of the bank of england did everything possible in the circumstances, and could have done no more had he been independent."
262,9/24/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Higgins," mr. ulster unionists are, therefore, opposed to the concept of european monetary union and a single currency since the inevitable consequence would be the transfer of this most fundamental power of government from the elected representatives of the people of the united kingdom to an unelected body which cannot be dismissed from office by united kingdom electors.  for the same reason, we oppose the creation of an independent central bank."
263,9/24/1992,Ulster Unionist Party,conservative,Mr. William Ross,"national governments should have the courage to exercise responsibly the power conferred by the electorate. agriculture has been sustained that way. no economic magic   devaluation, floating pound, exchange rate mechanism or independent central bank   will guarantee that britain retains and expands its industrial base."
264,9/24/1992,Labour,labour,Mr. Tony Senn," the real cause of the problem stretches across the house. i myself have long supported it, too, although i do not attribute to it the over-arching significance that the liberal party does. that nostrum is to bring about the independence of the bank of england."
265,9/24/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Whitney,"it is ironic that that was the first of the nationalisation measures of the labour government after the war, and the last move that the government now seem prepared to contemplate is the reversal of that policy. it is not true, as was suggested by one of my hon. friends, that had the bank of england been independent it would have acted differently, and would not have taken the sensible measures adopted by my right hon."
266,9/24/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Whitney,"friend the chancellor. however, an independent bank of england would have more credibility.  such a decision was reached by our noble friend lord lawson after he had spent five years as chancellor of the exchequer."
267,9/24/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Whitney,"he advised such a policy in 1988, and in a noteworthy speech made on 31 october 1989 he said:
 there is  ¦ one other way in which anti-inflationary credibility might be enhanced in the eyes of the market and that is why, a year ago, i proposed to my right hon. but that would be a buttress; it would not be a substitute"". i have held the view for a long time that, with the deregulation of financial institutions and the complete internationalisation of money markets, bank supervision is an extraordinarily difficult task."
268,10/22/1992,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"while i am certainly not one of those who are in favour of making the bank of england independent, i am very strongly in favour of its prestige being maintained as strongly as possible    i begin by congratulating my front bench on the decision to oppose the government in the division later this evening. the provisions of the treaty simply fly in the face of the best economic interests of this country."
269,11/4/1992,Labour,labour,Mr. Bryan Gould,"how can we accept a treaty that sets up an independent central bank which is to control and decide all the major questions of economic policy in a way which is directly and specifically said by the treaty to be unaccountable to any other influence, let alone the democratically elected governments of the community?  how can we accept provisions which direct those bankers, if they need such direction, to concentrate exclusively on price stability, even in the depths of the worst recession for two generations? we have got it the wrong way round in this country."
270,11/6/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"the central bank exercises a largely independent responsibility for banking supervision, but is totally subservient to the government on the matter of conducting monetary policy   the reverse of what should happen. there is a stronger case for closer accountability for banking supervision than for independence in monetary policy. i hope that we can think of a more catchy title if we devise such an institution in this country."
271,11/6/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"the government should look at the case for the separation of responsibilities, just as they should consider the argument for a more independent central bank. i know that the economic secretary has much sympathy with that argument. our alternative would be to give a substantial boost to capital spending, funded by additional borrowing."
272,11/18/1992,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"that would be combined with a sound basis for monetary policy by means of an independent central bank and direct help to business.  we also argue that it might have been more sensible in the current circumstances to help those businesses which would otherwise go to the wall, by providing a cut or holiday in the uniform business rate, rather than introducing a capital allowance scheme that helps only those businesses that expect to pay significant amounts of tax, against which they can use an allowance. sadly, history has had a habit of repeating itself."
273,11/18/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Richard Spring," the maastricht treaty requires during the second stage that member states should start the process leading to the independence of their own central banks. it is not clear that we would find it desirable to move towards a single currency or indeed that the convergence criteria will ever be successfully met. in its policy objectives, the bundesbank has been by and large successful."
274,11/18/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Richard Spring," the bundesbank is more substantially independent than the bank of england. that is important. the imf working paper, ""central bank independence: issues and experience"", noted that the results of most studies are that countries with independent central banks tend to deliver better inflation outcomes."
275,11/18/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Richard Spring,"had the bank of england been considerably more independent, over the past four decades we would have enjoyed lower inflation, a more stable currency and less volatile interest rates. surely it is time, particularly after the turbulent experiences of the summer, to look seriously at the structure of the bank and thereby the conduct of our monetary policy.  given the enormous and justified importance which hon."
276,11/18/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Richard Spring,"members place upon debate and parliamentary scrutiny, there might be concern that an independent bank of england would be unaccountable. there is clearly a difficulty, with a tension between parliamentary sovereignty and central bank independence. that needs to be addressed."
277,12/10/1992,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nelson,"members will know that other ec members have such a separation of powers with a banking commission as well as a central bank. with the arrival of a european central bank or independent central banks within member states, there is often a more compelling case for the separation of such powers. as we do not have that, we have no intention of changing our present arrangements."
278,1/13/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Corbyn,"friend has said about article 2 and its social objectives. does he concede that the whole basis of the maastricht treaty is the establishment of a european central bank which is staffed by bankers, independent of national governments and national economic policies, and whose sole policy is the maintenance of price stability? that will undermine any social objective that any labour government in the united kingdom   or any other government   would wish to carry out."
279,1/13/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Mandelson,"therefore, the entire central banking system would be biased against growth and employment and in favour of tight and rigidly applied monetary policies whose sole aim was deflation. finally, the relevant national central banks, rather than the european system of central banks, would have to mirror those provisions and be equally independent.  to the best of my ability, i have looked into the matter with care."
280,1/13/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Mandelson," my next point concerns not the system of european central banks but our national central bank. i can imagine no circumstances, and certainly no reading of the treaty, that yields the conclusion or inference that our own national central bank, however independent, would go entirely unconstrained by some element of political control under any government of any party, just as the german bundesbank does not go entirely unconstrained by political influence exercised by duly and properly elected ministers. the truth is that they are somewhat accountable and should be more accountable."
281,1/13/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Mandelson,"it is precisely the aim of the opposition's policies and proposed amendments to the bill to increase and enhance that political accountability and to strengthen that political framework within which decisions and the operation of the national central bank, as well as the system, take place.  just as the german bundesbank has, by law, to take account of the views of duly elected ministers and politicians, so would our own independent national central bank, and so, too, would the european system of central banks as a whole. i hope that the hon."
282,1/13/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,if the hon. gentleman and the labour party seek to alter that independence in the european central bank that will be the end of the treaty. i do not expect my hon.
283,1/13/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Macdonald,"friend necessarily to agree with my view here, but sometimes the whole question of independence of the central bank is rather exaggerated and overrated. the independence of the american federal reserve did not impede the pursuit of a new deal programme in the 1930s by the democratic party. the swedish central bank has been independent since, i think, the 16th or the 17th century and that has not impeded the pursuit of socialism in that country."
284,1/13/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Macdonald,"therefore, the question of independence is sometimes rather exaggerated. i do not recall reading in the labour party's manifesto   for which, i know, the right hon. gentleman is not responsible   or in our manifesto a proposal to set up an independent british central bank."
285,1/14/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Richard Shepherd,"i should like to know when that became labour policy and whether the right hon. gentleman thinks that it is an appropriate device for effecting a fundamental change in our economic management through the surrogacy of this maastricht treaty. the house has not debated the principles behind an independent central bank for this country alone, yet we are legislating for it without a proper debate."
286,1/14/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Davies,"that is right; it is article 108, i think, which will be enacted under the bill. members: ""since when?""] it was decided by the non-modernised labour party at last year's conference   i do not know what the modernised one will do. in a short composite resolution, it decided that the bank of england should be independent or autonomous."
287,1/14/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Davies,"i prefer ""autonomous"". does the hon. gentleman accept that his views, baroness thatcher's views or anyone else's views are irrelevant because the article on page 91 entitled ""independence"" makes it abundantly clear that, when the central bank is established, no government of any party, no chancellor of the exchequer or minister will be legally permitted even to make representations to it, to phone or to write, without committing the equivalent of a euro-crime?"
288,1/14/1993,Conservative,conservative,Teddy Taylor,"therefore, while he or baroness thatcher may be right, the fact is that the central bank will decide. whatever it does will be its own business, not that of democratic governments or parliaments. i shall deal later with the question of the independence of the central bank."
289,1/14/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Macdonald,"i was trying to say that, regardless of what it says in the treaty, there are different arguments about how its provisions should be interpreted. in other words, the treaty is not the end of political argument as some have implied because those who suggest that it is the end of political argument cannot agree even about which political argument has been brought to an end by the treaty   some say it is the monetarist argument and others say it is the socialist argument. irrespective of what different politicians have said about whether the treaty is monetarist, democratic socialist or anything else in character, surely there can be no dispute about the words in the treaty which describe the independence of the central bank."
290,1/14/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Shore,"part of the relevant article states that governments will undertake
 not to seek to influence
 it   there can be no argument about that. either the words mean what they say or they do not. as i said, i shall deal with the independence of the central bank in a moment."
291,1/14/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Macdonald,"my point is that arguments have been advanced from both parties that the treaty is somehow an end to political debate. gentleman has such doubts about the running of a bank which theoretically is state-owned and state-controlled, what influence does he think will be possible in the case of an independent central bank dedicated to a course of euro-monetarism? i am glad that my hon."
292,1/14/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Macdonald,"i had no intention of dealing with the details of german interest rates, mr. morris, but to make the general point that independent central banks are not immune to political influence. nor does the notion of an independent central bank mean that governments are constrained from carrying out policies that my hon."
293,1/14/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Macdonald,"friends would warmly support.  for example, an independent central bank in the united states did not prevent president roosevelt from carrying out a new deal programme to revive that economy out of recession. an independent central bank in sweden has not prevented successive governments from pursuing policies which many of my hon."
294,1/14/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Macdonald,"friends would like to see implemented in britain. i am simply trying to establish that the vision of an independent central bank being inimical to any kind of social development or political progress is not borne out by the experience of other countries with independent central banks. that applies to sweden and the united states, which have been able to carry through progressive social and economic policies."
295,1/14/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Macdonald,"indeed, if we compare the experience of germany and sweden with that of the united kingdom   with labour governments here having to wrestle with a supposedly dependent central bank   my argument is borne out. in giving a general blessing to the convergence criteria, to the narrowness and rigidity of the treaty, and to the idea of an independent central european bank   and with that an independent bank of england   is my hon. friend in line with labour party policy as expressed by the front-bench spokesmen?"
296,1/14/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Macdonald,"as i said when i spoke about an independent central bank in an intervention last night, i did not expect that all my hon. friends would agree with me on that subject. tonight i have tried to argue that blind resistance to any notion of an independent central bank is not necessarily grounded in real fears about the economic and social consequences involved."
297,1/14/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Macdonald,"if one compares the experience of the united kingdom to that in germany or sweden, my argument is that to have a politically independent central bank does not necessarily lead to the economic and social goals that my hon. friends want. gentleman and others believe that it will severely limit the ability of member states to decide their economic policy."
298,2/25/1993,Plaid Cymru,Others,Mr. Jones,"i know that they fear the creation of an independent european central bank. however, the opponents of the treaty had to recognise on 4 february that the powers in that treaty are subject to a number of qualifications. it pays attention to them, but it controls monetary policy short term, and that gives monetary policy and the setting of short-term interest rates additional credibility, which our system lacks."
299,3/16/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Howell," i should like to see a more independent bank of england, without a total separation between the monetary authority and the treasury. that would avoid the over-politicisation of interest rates and would enable that whole side of the budgetary balance to be managed in a more sophisticated way.  i also welcome the changes set out in the budget concerning the monetary framework, particularly in the full funding rule."
300,3/17/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Legg,"again, there are parallels with the united states, where in recent years the federal reserve, an independent central bank, has been underfunding the deficit and providing support to financial institutions and banks in that country. we need the same mechanism to operate here because our financial institutions have been hard hit during the united kingdom's membership of the exchange rate mechanism.  we need to limit the tendency to import, and that means a competitive pound."
301,3/22/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Robert Sheldon,"the voices of the city and the bank of england, which would dearly like to emulate the power and independence of the bundesbank, must be resisted. the lack of political influence of our manufacturing industry has always been one of the serious weaknesses of our economy. gentleman saying that he expects section 4 of the bank of england act 1946 to be repealed?"
302,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. William Cash,"in other words, does he want an independent central bank in this country? if so, how does he relate that to the concession that he has already made, in that there will be no arrangements for the central bank in europe to be accountable? as with other aspects of the bill, the choice facing us is not between influence through the pooling of sovereignty on the one hand and influence outside that pooling on the other; it is a choice between influence through the community and precious little influence at all."
303,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith," on the question of the status of the central banks, it is clear that the european central bank would need to be independent in its day-to-day organisations. the bundesbank is responsible for the internal value of the mark. the central bank would be a bank based on the model of the bundesbank, which has an extremely large measure of independence and autonomy."
304,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith,"i have said that there would be increased transparency in relations between the bank and the government and, for that matter, between the bank and the house of commons.  in debating this matter, it is important that we do not react as a house of commons or, more widely, as a country with the rancid conservatism of old institutions resisting change, rather than engaging constructively in the possibilities of change. as will hutton, the economics editor of the guardian, said at a meeting on this subject, one of the specific difficulties which many in britain, and especially in england, have with the concept of an independent central bank is grappling with the concept of pluralism in political and economic institutions."
305,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith," we need to recognise that there can be democratically determined public institutions working within a framework of law which have an obligation to pursue defined objectives of public interest in ways which are accountable but which are free from day-to-day control of the government, if never dissociated from their influence and the wider policy framework. member for oxford, east and others, hon. members, friends and business associates around the world have often asked me why i am so concerned about an independent central bank, when the united states and germany have independent central banks."
306,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"to my astonishment, lord lawson was apparently a secret believer in an independent central bank. like the prime minister, he was part of a silent minority. apparently there were a lot of silent minorities in lady thatcher's cabinet."
307,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell," as there are independent central banks in germany and the united states, which are clearly democratic countries, people ask me why i am concerned that we cannot do the same in britain and europe. i want to address that argument.  i should like to consider the word ""independence""."
308,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"the present governor of the bank of england, for whom i have great personal regard and for whose recent personal bereavement we all feel extremely sad, said that he favoured an independent central bank, as did his nominated successor. i wonder whether they really mean what they say. is it not a fact that there is much in the arrangements that have evolved in the united states which is not only attractive in regard to what it does for genuine parliamentary accountability in this area but could provide a model for the future development of the european community?"
309,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Forman,"what i have in mind is a matching of the degree of ex post accountability to the european parliament for the european system of central banks in future with a similar, transparent accountability, again ex-post, to this parliament for our own, more independent, central bank in this country. so why, i ask, do we think that it is acceptable for us? when the financial secretary asked me on 14 january why, when the united states had an independent central bank in the federation, i was worrying about a central bank for europe, that is the american part of my answer."
310,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"on the first of my hon. so there is no proof that independence and non-accountability alone or necessarily produce great economic success.  king william iii, who was a dutchman   perhaps the dutch have a flair for that sort of thing   established our central bank to be independent but accountable, and to be run by our fellow countrymen."
311,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,ten of the 11 other member states have always followed suit and have had accountable central banks. it has all happened before.  i should like now to turn to the question of who first established an independent and unaccountable central bank.
312,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"it was not, as many people think, bismarck in 1870. by contrast, the reichsbank overnight became hitler's creature and provided him with the sinews of war.  people should not be under the illusion that an unaccountable central bank will show a degree of political independence, integrity and liberalism when faced with ruthless and corrupt politicians."
313,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"history does not suggest that. members may persuade the electorate or the bbc or john birt by some special financial arrangement that it is about something else, but they should not try to kid people who have been here long enough to know otherwise. if the chancellor of the exchequer were committing an offence if he tried to influence the central bank, which is what the treaty says, how can that possibly be the maintenance of an independent nation?"
314,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Benn, i am not a nationalist. we are not arguing about nationalism versus internationalism: we are on a wholly different issue. international capital is not controlled by handing it over to the archbishop and bishops of international capital   the independent central bankers.
315,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Benn," listening to my hon. friend's suggestion that independent central banks cannot be politically accountable is not borne out by the facts. clearly, whatever system is set up to try to give such banks independence, they will all ultimately be susceptible to political pressures from whichever political institution happens to be in place."
316,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Legg,"does my right hon. friend realise that, when there is an independent european central bank, there will be one interest rate for the whole of europe? germany, italy, spain and the united kingdom will have one interest rate."
317,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Dr. Roger Berry, the objective is clear. we have an independent central bank which is to be established with the legal requirement that its overriding objective should be zero inflation. none of that is accidental.
318,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Dr. Roger Berry,"that is not only nonsense but dangerous nonsense. it is why price stability is the overriding objective for the european central bank, and why we are to have an independent central bank with the constitutional requirement to pursue price stability at all costs.  the monetarism is self-evident, and it should be a cause for concern not only among the opposition."
319,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Dr. Berry,"of course one could have no objection to aiming for price stability, because one would believe that it did not affect unemployment or growth. one could not object to setting up an independent central bank beyond anyone else's control, with the specific requirement to achieve price stability, because that would not affect the real economy, so there would be no problem.  to a hard-line monetarist, there is, of course, no difficulty with the proposals, but unfortunately for those who support the maastricht treaty, no one believes that nonsense any longer   not even the present government."
320,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Dr. Berry,but there is a treaty before us which contains words and which we must read and understand. running through the many pages of the treaty dealing with economic matters is the single-minded obsession with the monetarist objective of zero inflation and the monetarist instrument of an independent central bank controlling monetary policy. there is nothing of the kind to which my hon.
321,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Dr. Berry,"if one produces a budget, one must discuss how it is to be paid for. it would be ridiculous to have one body   in this case an independent european central bank   setting monetary policy, whatever the objectives, with fiscal policy for europe being determined somewhere else.  there is logic in the argument that, if there is to be monetary union in the european community and a single currency, we must have political union as well so that there can be democratic control of economic policy."
322,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Malcolm Bruce," the treaty is about trying to take a step forward to build mechanisms, which will have to evolve as the community has evolved since its inception. it is no secret to the committee that my party has long argued the case for an independent central bank for the united kingdom, and not only for the european community as it develops. i should like to say why we think that an independent central bank is desirable   i stress ""independent"" rather than ""unaccountable""."
323,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Mandelson,"the reasons for the hon. gentleman's party's support for an independent central bank will be of great interest to the committee. before giving those reasons, however, will he say whether the independent central bank that he advocates should have absolutely no political relationship with parliament?"
324,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Mandelson,why have his hon. i shall not make the mistake of giving way to him again.  the first argument that we have made is that the pragmatic evidence is that independent central banks have an extremely good record of bearing down on inflation.
325,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"there is plenty of evidence, not just theoretical but practical, to show that, when a bank acts independently, the record on reducing inflation is extremely good. a study published in 1991 by vittorio grilli expressed that graphically. it said:
 central bank independence is tantamount to free lunch: it delivers low inflation with no apparent costs to the real economy's macroeconomic performance."
326,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"i intend to develop my argument in my own way. alternatively, if they decide to opt in without having gone through the second stage, how can they proceed from the first stage to the third without transition?  i understand that, under the terms of the treaty, stage 2 requires us to make preparations to bring our own domestic central bank into line with the provisions of the independent bank that would be required by stage 3."
327,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"if the government resist the mechanism, how are we to achieve that in one go? there is a danger that we shall suddenly have to run extremely fast to catch up if we finally decide to go for monetary union. that is why i believe it makes sense for britain to consider creating a more independent central bank, on its own merits and on our own terms, whether or not we opt for monetary union."
328,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"first   as i have argued   that would be a better way in which to run the british economy; secondly, it would achieve the transition from an independent british bank to european monetary union with much less disruption than would otherwise occur. that in itself gives scope for a more democratic approach.  it is our contention that an independent central bank will be much more effective in pursuing policies which will bring down inflation."
329,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"that is not only theoretically true but practically proven in countries which have such an institution. friend the member for durham, north (mr. radice) is saying that it is proper and legitimate for price stability to be a primary goal for an independent central bank to pursue."
330,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Mandelson,"but it is not the only goal. it is up to ministers and other politicians to decide among those goals, but it is proper for the central bank to try to pursue that goal of price stability. before i was so rudely interrupted, i was making the case for the european central bank, and i was saying that there is a strong argument for independent operation."
331,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Radice,"i felt that the bundesbank was a very effective model because, although it was operationally independent, it worked within an overall economic policy which was laid down by politicians. i argued that we should support the idea of a european central bank because, if we wanted a single market, we had to have a single currency, and if we had a single currency we would need a single monetary authority. i argued that there was a case for having an independent central bank, and in this i argued against my hon."
332,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Radice,"friend the member for kingswood (dr. like other hon. members, i shall say something about the independence of the european central bank because it merits considerable discussion; but, before i do, i wish to mention the concept of the central bank and a single currency."
333,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Shore,the two clearly go together: we shall not have a central bank unless we are to have a single currency. we have established that point.  the independence of the european central bank has been the subject of considerable discussion already.
334,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Shore,"i have made it clear that i believe that the single currency idea is basically flawed. i understand that many hon. members are interested in the question whether a european central bank should be independent, more or less on the german model, or should be brought under ecofin."
335,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Shore, it is not necessary to read article 107 again. no one who attaches any importance to the meaning of words can doubt the strength of the commitment to an independent central bank. it is extraordinary.
336,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nicholas Winterton,"gentleman has referred to the ""independence"" of the new european central bank, but is he not misguided in using that word? does he not mean that it is unaccountable? friend thinks that the bundesbank is such a shining example to us all, will he tell us why we have not emulated that example before?"
337,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gill,"secondly, may i remind him of the question that i asked earlier about the irony of the fact that the government do not support an independent bank of england, yet are prepared to support an independent central bank? if we are even to give ourselves the option to move towards signing up for european monetary union   and allowing for the fact that the government have kept their options open   would it not be logical and sensible to move now towards establishing an independent bank of england so as to make the final transition that much easier and our understanding of how the arrangements work that much better? i am merely pointing out that those who have argued that article 107 prevents hon."
338,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"member for bethnal green and stepney argued that the provisions for the independence of the central bank were a major departure from anything seen before. they are very similar indeed to the arrangements for the independence of the members of the commission which were introduced by the treaty of rome, which says:
 members of the commission, in the performance of these duties, shall neither seek nor take instructions from any government or any other body
 and it provides that
 member states undertake to respect this principle and not to seek to influence members of the commission in the performance of their tasks. there is a difference, though i am not sure that i would accept the description of it as a big one."
339,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"i do not deny that the central bank is set up to be independent and that the provisions are designed to ensure its independence, and i shall discuss how accountability is to be delivered in the context of those independence provisions. when i asked the minister a question relating to article 109j(1), he said that there was no obligation for the united kingdom to move towards the independence of the central bank until the third stage. i draw his attention to article 109e(5), which clearly states:
 during the second stage, each member state shall, as appropriate, start the process leading to the independence of its central bank""."
340,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Andrew Smith, when will the government take a decision on that? i did not say that we had no obligation to introduce an independent central bank until we had moved to a single currency. i said that we were not obliged to do so unless and until we decided that we wished to move to a single currency.
341,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"this evening, the committee is not being asked to give the green light to a single currency. the decisions that the committee is making in the context of this bill have no consequences for the independence of the bank of england, for parliamentary control of our existing monetary policy arrangements or, as the right hon. member for chesterfield argued, for the conservative tradition of a strong and free united kingdom or, indeed, the labour party tradition, which he identified as standing against the interests of capital."
342,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell," the day may come when the house is asked to decide to adopt a single currency, with the institutional arrangements that i have described, but we are not at that day now. if we decided to go to stage 3 we would have to consider the issue of an independent central bank under the arrangements that i have described. we would also have to establish to our satisfaction our own procedures for making those arrangements accountable."
343,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Hain,"the reason why i am so critical of the treaty is that the economic framework, specifically in terms of establishing an unaccountable central bank, is bad for our economy and society.  when one examines the origins of the proposal to establish a central bank, one finds that it was framed during the high tide of monetarism in the 1980s, when european policy makers hatched the idea of the independent european central bank. the intellectual fashion was for monetarist ideas."
344,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Hain,the independent central bank was an example of that. it will be the driving force behind maastricht. all those factors have created an entirely new situation which should have been recognised.
345,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Hain,"it requires a renegotiation of the treaty's economic framework, especially the establishment of an independent central bank. i am following the hon. gentleman's speech closely and i find myself in considerable agreement with it."
346,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nicholas Winterton,"he has just come on to the establishment of an independent european central bank. bearing in mind the control that that bank will have and the criteria on which it will operate, will not it produce massive unemployment throughout the european community? member does not mind, but i shall be happy to give way later."
347,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Hain," under this treaty the european central bank will be an independent institution. it will be required, as article 3a specifies, to be single-mindedly dedicated to low inflation, virtually regardless of the consequences for employment and social equality. it will be specifically prevented from being accountable to the elected national governments."
348,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Hain,"if the timetable is strictly adhered to, the bank of england would have to be privatised, or at least made fully independent, by 1999, as is already happening in france and has just been completed in spain.  the independence of the european central bank is uncompromisingly spelled out in chapter 2, article 107   another one that i want to quote for the record:
 when exercising the powers and carrying out the tasks and duties conferred upon them by this treaty and the statute of the escb, neither the escb, nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision-making bodies shall seek or take instructions from community institutions or bodies, from any government of a member state or from any other body.  the community institutions and bodies and the governments of the member states undertake to respect this principle and not to seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ecb or of the national central banks in the performance of their tasks."
349,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Winterton,"friend the minister in the previous debate   if you will allow me about 15 seconds, mr. lofthouse   about the importance of an independent bank, the most economically successful country in the world has been, and still is, japan, which has a central bank   the bank of japan   which is extremely dependent. it is not independent but extremely accountable to the japanese government."
350,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Winterton,"all the nonsense that ministers talk about the vital role of an independent european central bank is similar to much of what they say.  sadly, the japanese now have a shortage of capital, and that is likely to continue for some time. no doubt we can return to that debate."
351,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Davies," article 109e (5) which deals with the bank of england, says:
 during the second stage, each member state shall, as appropriate, start the process leading to the independence of its central bank in accordance with article 108.  that is a legal obligation. that is as it may be, but something has to be done by a member state, as my hon."
352,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Davies,"friend the member for oxford, east pointed out, to
 start the process leading to the independence of its central bank"".  what is meant by the
 independence of its central bank
 is that the statute governing that central bank must be as nearly identical as possible to the statute governing the european central bank, which is also independent. it makes sense that they should be mirror images, like the german lÃ¤nder banks and the bundesbank."
353,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"furthermore, clause 2 provides that we would not be able to exercise our option of moving to stage 2 without a further piece of legislation going through the house. clearly, as part of that legislative process, we should have to provide for an independent central bank which satisfied the terms of the treaty   if we chose to go to a single currency. we should have to provide arrangements for the bank of england which satisfied the treaty, if we chose to exercise our option under our protocol."
354,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Davies,"we have not been told that before, so now we can move on. of course, it means that the government do not believe in an independent bank of england. the present british set-up is excellent; the governor gives his advice, and the prime minister and chancellor decide."
355,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Davies,"by that means, the french have done well   better than the germans   on inflation. we note with interest that the government are not rushing to create the great independent central bank, which we shall have to accept if we go for the idea. friend is perhaps being too generous to the financial secretary, who said that no step need be taken towards the establishment of an independent central bank unless and until the preconditions for the implementation of stage 3 are acted on."
356,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Gould,"yet that is contradicted by the words that my right hon. friend quoted. they provide that under stage 2   the question whether we ever get to stage 3 is irrelevant   each member state shall   it is a mandatory use of language   start the process, leading to the establishment of the independent central bank."
357,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Gould,"so my right hon. we may never reach that stage, but that mandatory obligation would be in force as we proceeded through stage 2. i do not know about that, but certainly article 8 mentions   it is the same article about independence as we find in the central bank protocol   "
358,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Davies,"the financial secretary shakes his head, but that is a perfectly reasonable interpretation of what may not be an easy article. i suggest that, within the context of both the emi and the central bank, and the thrust of the independence of those institutions, the european court might he more likely to accept my interpretation than that of the financial secretary. i concede that, even if i had been privy to the advice of my former tutor, i think that i would have had some difficulty in interpreting the article on my own."
359,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Davies,"it may be that the two circles will occasionally cross, creating something of a problem. so far as i can see, in the exercise of the duties in respect of the emi, which may very well be different from those relating to the bank of england, the governor will be independent. i should like to direct my right hon."
360,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Hain,"friend's attention to two sentences that the financial secretary was very reluctant to read out. these are identical to the wording of article 7 on page 91, which specifically details the independence criteria governing the european central bank. i should think that the court will take note of that."
361,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Spicer,"member for llanelli raised the matter of the wording in article 109e(5):
 during the second stage, each member state shall, as appropriate, start the process leading to the independence of its central bank, in accordance with article 108"".  the financial secretary said that that does not mean what it looks like: it means that the legislation which is required to move towards an independent bank will be introduced only if the decision is made to move to a single currency. friend may also be aware that at present european central banks in france and spain in particular are moving towards independence."
362,3/24/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Legg,it is not beyond the realms of fantasy to believe that some of our partners in europe may take us to the european court to make us start the process of taking our bank to independence because of the additional credibility that they would see that lending to emu. friends' criticisms of the economic and monetary policy contained in the treaty. the development of those processes and of the independent central bank are some of the key issues.
363,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Betts,"i have major reservations about an independent bank and how it can operate within economic and monetary union, because that highlights some of the potential conflicts between the economic and monetary aspects of the treaty.  i therefore believe that, in ratifying the treaty, we are being asked to accept that, once we accept stage 2, stage 3 will ultimately follow. the government will no doubt argue that there is an alternative to joining the independent central bank   stage 2, in which the bank of england, would be separate and independent, in a nationalistic sense."
364,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Betts,"to some extent, it would be independent of the rest of the european community.  i do not believe that if every other country in the european community is a member of the central bank, which will have the power of all the other governments and economies behind it, one country can realistically stand aside and believe that it will be feasible for its central bank to operate independently while that country remained a member of the community. the government cannot ask any hon."
365,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Betts,"as i said earlier, one problem is that some of the economic criteria in the treaty appear to have been written in different languages and emphasise different points from the monetary criteria.  i am concerned about the independent central bank, not only because of the independence but because of article 105, which my hon. friend the member for dagenham (mr."
366,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Betts,"one of the problems is that the treaty is open to different interpretations, depending on which article one selects and which aspect one emphasises to make a particular point. the one issue about which i have real concern is the independence of the central bank. friend knows my views about that matter."
367,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Betts,"i cannot be eclectic about it because, although i believe that it will be possible politically to interpret some of the criteria in the treaty in a way which would be favourable to my arguments, i agree that the independence of the central bank is a major worry in that regard. eventually, it will be found to be wanting and we shall have to readdress it in a fundamental way. in particular, the government gave no clear guidance on the point made by my right hon."
368,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Livingstone,friend the member for llanelli about what lay in store for us in the move towards an independent central bank. various other opposition members made key points. gentleman has referred to perhaps the most serious and threatening of all the maastricht proposals.
369,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Livingstone,"not only are we creating the independent european central bank that we have been discussing; not only are its appointees appointed for a single term of seven years   as there is no prospect of their being given a second term, they are free to do what they wish without accountability; but, in voting for the treaty, we waive our rights to influence them. at least the bundesbank currently comes under pressure from politicians and the federal reserve bank comes under pressure from the president.  we need the chancellor and senior law officers here to give definitive rulings on the bill."
370,3/24/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Livingstone,"what would be the impact on the chancellor if the bill were passed and we found that the independence of our own central bank were adversely affected? appointees to the national central banks will serve a five-year term, but we have received no assurance that the system could not be abused politically. davies) in the early hours of the morning."
371,3/25/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Renton,"while there was much that he said with which i did not agree, at one point i thought that he was on, at least, interesting ground   the starting of the process leading towards the independence of the central bank.  i understood my hon. friend to say clearly this morning that there was no intention of starting towards that process."
372,3/25/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Renton,"i agree with moving towards an independent central hank, because i think that it would be better if monetary policy were run by a central bank that was more or less independent of us politicians. that is by the way. renton), the former chief whip, whom i always treat with great respect."
373,3/25/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"he asked me to address the question of the independence of national central banks and whether it was true that we would be able to pursue the policy that i described as our policy   to maintain our existing arrangements for the bank of england unless and until we decided to make the choice to move to stage 3. i will take the committee through the relevant texts which the government believe safeguard our right to leave the bank of england in its present condition indefinitely, unless and until we choose to move to stage 3.  the first text that the committee needs to examine is article 108, which says:
 each member state shall ensure, at the latest at the date of the establishment of the escb, that its national legislation including the statutes of its national central bank is compatible with this treaty""   
 in other words, provides for independence."
374,3/25/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell," article 109e provides:
 each member state shall, as appropriate,""   
 those were the two words that were regularly missed out by those asking me about these provisions earlier in the debate   
 start the process leading to the independence of its central bank, in accordance with article 108""   
 the article that we have just examined. the committee could be forgiven for concluding that the significance of the words ""as appropriate"" is a little obscure, but those two words were written in to accommodate the fact that the united kingdom, under its protocol, has no obligation to move to stage 3, and therefore no need to provide for the independence of its central bank within the terms of the treaty.  the key phrase is ""as appropriate""."
375,3/25/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,it is the inclusion of those words which exempts the united kingdom from what would otherwise be a treaty obligation to initiate a process to provide for the independence of the central bank. article 109j(1) does not of itself give rise to obligations. it provides that the commission and the emi report on the performance of member states against obligations which arise from outside that article.
376,3/25/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"the argument that i am advancing is that, because of the inclusion in article 109e(5) of the phrase ""as appropriate"", the united kingdom does not have an obligation to provide for the independence of its central bank. i shall not go into that.  the opt-out and our non-commitment to move to stage 3 occupied much of the financial secretary's speech."
377,3/25/1993,Liberal Democrat,Others,Russell Johnston,"we regret the opt-out and, logically, regret the unwillingness of the government to take the other consequential steps, particularly making the bank of england independent as a prelude to the establishment of one european community central bank.  it is not often that i agree with the hon. member wished to raise matters that are meant to be disposed of for ever, not just for this year or next year, not determined by a general election, as all that has been swept aside."
378,4/15/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Richard Shepherd," we are shifting our seat of government from the control of the people to an unelected bureaucracy, a council of ministers that meets in secret who will rule on transport, education and the whole range of apparatus of the state, including setting up an independent central bank well beyond the call of any one individual nation.  when we grind on about the consequences of the erm and when the government bring it back in the middle of the night, as they did two weeks ago, and when they guillotine it like this, i learn one thing from the progress of the debate.  as it happened, there were three consecutive debates which encompassed the evil heart of emu."
379,4/19/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Shore,"we debated the powers, independence and non-accountability of the european central bank; the totally unacceptable 3 per cent. of gross domestic product capping of government borrowing requirement; and the content of stages 2 and 3 of economic and monetary union.  the matter is serious."
380,4/19/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Leighton,"if we have a single currency, which is the objective of the treaty, we get a single central bank which, we are told, will be independent. that is a nice word, although autonomous would also do. friend could say that such matters have already been disposed of, but i find it difficult to present to the british nation as a whole the facts that there is a range of laws, that there is an independent central bank elsewhere issuing currency, and that, despite all our experience, there is a drive towards the reinstatement of the exchange rate mechanism in stage 2."
381,4/21/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Shepherd,"it is a moot point. we are planning   at least for the time being   a life outside the exchange rate mechanism. in addition, the government are certainly not going to give the bank of england the independence that it dearly wants."
382,4/26/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Sheldon," the government are right in that respect. does he not realise the consternation that would be caused in the markets if we debated here whether to rejoin the erm, on what terms and so on? does he not appreciate that the conduct of monetary policy must therefore be left in the hands of the executive branch or   better still in my view   in those of an independent central bank?"
383,5/4/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies,"such decisions can be announced to the world only when they have effectively been taken.  it is not good enough to quote article 2 as the bible of the treaty when its provisions are overridden and swept aside by the much tighter, more specific constraints in article 3a. the policeman of this monetary regime, the independent european central bank, has its independence uncompromisingly spelt out in article 107."
384,5/4/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Hain,"i shall not describe all the details of the banking regime because that would take me beyond the terms of the amendments. it is driving the german economy into deep recession at huge cost to industry and at massive cost to social relations   with the rise of nazism and all the other problems that we see in germany now.  when an independent central bank pursues price stability in a dogmatic and fanatical fashion, the consequences are the rising unemployment and deflation we see throughout europe, yet the treaty invites us to adopt exactly that agenda and framework."
385,5/4/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Hain," a recent worldwide academic study showed that there is no relationship between the dogmatic pursuit of price stability and zero or low inflation and economic growth and success.  according to the treaty, on 1 january 1994, a mere seven months away, stage 2 of the process towards economic and monetary union starts. under stage 2, we are committed to moving the bank of england to independence from political control."
386,5/20/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tim Renton (Mid-Sussex),"one has only to read article 109e, paragraph 5, to see that. i hope that we shall take that course early on. when i look at countries with independent central banks   notably the united states and the federal republic of germany   i see, despite the hiccups in germany at present, that those countries have shown over decades consistently higher rates of growth since 1945 than we have."
387,5/20/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tim Renton (Mid-Sussex)," one conclusion must be that bankers, not politicians, are better at deciding questions of monetary growth and consequential interest rates. and hon. friends know, for some time i have favoured an independent bank of england."
388,5/20/1993,Conservative,conservative,Peter Hordern,many opponents of the maastricht treaty would like to blame our membership of the erm for the recession. nothing would be more effective in establishing the government's credibility than if my right hon. friend would have the courage to establish an independent central bank in this country.
389,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Norman lamont,"the time has come to make the bank of england independent. it is my greatest regret that, after two and a half years of trying, i failed to persuade the prime minister of this essential reform. in his speech, my right hon."
390,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,The Prime Minister (Mr. John Major),"friend spoke of a number of matters of very great importance, including the case that we have discussed on many occasions over the past two years for an independent central bank.  i share my right hon. that is an issue that we discussed frequently."
391,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,The Prime Minister (Mr. John Major),"we both saw the case for an independent central bank, able to take decisions on the implementation of monetary policy. there is a genuine case for that.  the very real concern that i have always faced is one that i believe is spread widely across the house: the need for accountability to parliament for decisions on monetary policy matters."
392,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,The Prime Minister (Mr. John Major),"were a way to be found to get the benefits of an independent central bank without the loss of parliamentary accountability, my views would be very close to those of my right hon. friend, but i have to say to my right hon. friend   i believe, from our many discussions, that it is a view he shares   that what is more important than the institutional arrangements is the underlying policy that is actually being followed."
393,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,The Prime Minister (Mr. John Major),"on that, i do not believe that an independent central bank would have brought down inflation any more rapidly than we have been able to achieve.  [interruption.] that is something for which i am happy to pay tribute to my right hon. they want a government who will set a clear strategy and who will stick to it."
394,6/9/1993,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,"they want a strategy that will encourage small businesses, stimulate enterprise, initiate a powerful programme to get the long-term unemployed back to work, give a clear lead so that britain can make the best out of its future in europe, prudently invest in the future, especially in skills and in a modern infrastructure, and give independence to the bank of england to act as a bulwark against inflation.  was it not amazing that we heard for the second time in the resignation speech by the right hon. member for kingston upon thames that he wished britain to have an independent central bank?"
395,6/9/1993,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,"is it not extraordinary that the two previous chancellors have taken that view, but that they have been prepared to say so only after they have resigned?  i am firmly convinced that the so-called fault lines in the erm are so fundamental that it would not be appropriate for us to consider rejoining the erm in the foreseeable future. the basic fault line in the system is the fact that an independent central bank in germany is preoccupied with reducing inflation and is concerned only with german interests and not with the overall economic situation in europe or the world."
396,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,Terence Higgins," while that situation persists, it would be inappropriate for more than a small number of countries even to consider joining the erm.  in his resignation speech, my right hon. friend the member for kingston upon thames spoke about the need for an independent central bank in britain."
397,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,Terence Higgins,"however, for the reasons set out by the prime minister, that would be wrong. it is a little paradoxical for my right hon. friend the member for kingston upon thames to say that we need an independent central bank to control inflation when, without such a bank, we have reduced inflation to its lowest level for about 30 years."
398,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,Terence Higgins," i shall concentrate on the more important issues of the future. lamont), the former chancellor, made a very interesting personal statement, which i commend. he made the interesting point that he had argued for an independent central bank."
399,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,Peter Hordern,"i have been on about this for some time. friend the member for kingston upon thames and lord lawson, both former chancellors, have said that our anti-inflation policy would be more credible with an independent central bank. i have advocated that for a long time, and i hope that my right hon."
400,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,Peter Hordern,"friend the prime minister will consider the matter. in exactly the same way as it is co-ordinated in the united states and the federal republic of germany, where the independent central bank is given a responsibility to control inflation. for that reason, it is totally in control of interest rates."
401,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,Peter Hordern,"it is by no means possible, either in germany or the united states, but i maintain that it is a better position than the one we have here. monetary policy is not as credible as it might be if the central bank were independent. an independent central bank's position would be very much easier if there were not such a large deficit."
402,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,Peter Hordern,"i think that my right hon. friend referred to the independence of the central bank and the erm, as did my right hon. friend the prime minister."
403,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Willetts,the main policy issue that he raised as a point of disagreement between himself and my right hon. friend the prime minister was the case for an independent central bank. he argued for it on the ground that there was a need to bring extra credibility to monetary policy.
404,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Willetts,"friend the member for kingston upon thames referred to the improvement in the yield curve. that was achieved because credibility was gained without having a new, legally independent central bank.  it is also possible to gain greater operational independence for the bank of england without putting it on a new statutory footing."
405,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Willetts,"indeed, significant progress was made under my right hon. that no longer happens.  instead, in a welcome policy innovation, the bank of england produces an independent report on the government's inflation performance and on prospects for inflation."
406,6/9/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Willetts,neither ministers nor officials would wish or dare to tamper with that.  the irony in my right hon. friend's remarks this afternoon was therefore that the objective which he seeks    gaining greater credibility for monetary policy by operational independence for the bank of england   is one towards which significant progress was actually made during his chancellorship.
407,6/11/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Julian Brazier,"we should be thinking about easing the money supply, rather than tightening it. if we want one strong case this morning against an independent bank of england, it is that the bank of england is saying that the worries are in the other direction at present.  i shall focus more specifically on the manufacturing economy."
408,6/11/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Julian Brazier,"therefore, i will not repeat what he said beyond saying that the annual review is important. did any head of government at copenhagen make the point that it was somewhat futile to have a community summit with unemployment at the head of the economic agenda when the terrible and still worsening unemployment position in the community has been caused largely by the past, present and continuing high interest rate policies of the independent central bank of germany? i include the scottish national party, which is willing to give up scotland's independence and to cede its sovereignty to the european parliament in a way that would be much more damaging to scottish interests than in the sovereignty of this parliament."
409,7/6/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. McAllion,"the snp, for example, supports an independent central bank beyond any kind of political control. two issues will be decided tonight: a minor one and a major one. labour party members and our supporters have not yet understood that what is proposed, which the front-bench spokesmen of my party have accepted, is that it entails the handover of the powers of economic decision-making to unelected bodies in europe."
410,7/22/1993,Labour,labour,Mr. Peter Shore,"they have not yet understood that it will allow those bodies to decide the chancellor's budget and his borrowing requirement, it will abolish the bank of england as a nationalised industry and hand it over to a totally independent european central bank that will decide the interest rates and exchange rates of our country.  the labour party front-bench spokesmen and our shadow chancellor need to offer something in return to the british people. members who cast their votes tonight."
411,11/25/1993,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"why does not the chancellor seize the opportunity to lock in that monetary discipline and make himself the first chancellor to recognise the merits of an independent central bank while still in office, rather than waiting until he has left it? my joke the other day may have been misunderstood. beith), but i warn him that there are much bigger and more serious matters of parliamentary accountability to be addressed before anybody makes a decision one way or another about the independence of a central bank."
412,11/25/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke," i remind the opposition of our more serious economic achievements, on which everybody in the house should be concentrating on building.  we know that labour talks about radical changes in the city. one of the novel ideas for the bank of england, of all institutions   it will never be independent under a labour government   is that it should promote industrial investment."
413,11/25/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke,"it is strange for a labour government to channel their intervention through a central bank into direct investment in industry. stable prices would be of great benefit to them. therefore, i believe that further consideration should be given to the independence of the bank of england."
414,11/25/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Legg," secondly, the queen's speech stated the aim of continued economic growth. that position is not sustainable. amendment proposed, at the end of the question, to add:but humbly regret that the gracious speech fails to provide for the increased investment and reforms in education that are essential for improving the country's economic competitiveness and expanding individual opportunity; lacks a coherent economic programme to increase public and private investment, including policies to promote competition and encourage small businesses and legislation to establish the operational independence of the bank of england; makes no provision for promoting sustainable development policies; fails to advance a clear strategy to secure for the people of the united kingdom the full benefits of participation in the european community; contains no policy by which the government will seek to work within strong supranational institutions to preserve peace, protect the environment and combat poverty; does not foreshadow a comprehensive review of the nation's defence needs; and contains no measures to improve the public's confidence in the institutions of government."
416,12/7/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nicholas Budgen,"there is much to be said for making it plain that the bank of england has a special status and is not merely the dogsbody of the treasury. as well as cutting the budget deficit, there was a very welcome reduction in interest rates announced the week before the budget.  we have heard the arguments about the conduct of monetary policy and the arguments for and against an independent central bank, particularly from my hon."
417,12/7/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Willetts,"friend the member for wolverhampton, south-west (mr. budgen). there are arguments for giving the bank of england greater independence."
418,12/7/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Willetts,"when i think back to my days as an official in the treasury's monetary policy division 10 years ago, i am embarrassed about the way that articles appearing in the bank of england's quarterly bulletin were sent to us for detailed textual scrutiny; every paragraph had to be checked and suggestions made so that it was identical to the treasury view. the fact that the bank of england now has its own independent role in commenting on the government's performance in attaining its inflation objectives is clearly an improvement.  one of the achievements of the budget is that it has tightened fiscal policy and, at the same time, made some loosening of monetary policy possible."
419,12/7/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Willetts,"it is acceptable that the announcements of tax increases and interest rate cuts should go together.  some people say that the problem of the credibility of financial policy requires an independent central bank.  if 10-year gilt rates are down to 7 per cent., that suggests that the city has no doubt about the government's ability to hold down the rate of inflation in the long term."
420,12/7/1993,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Willetts,"some of the more radical arguments for an independent central bank are not borne out by the evidence.  my second point on the budget concerns a subject that is rather shrouded in esoteric mystery   the announcement in the budget about improved resource accounting in the public sector. i have given way enough, and i have a long speech to make."
421,1/14/1994,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Kirkwood," an independent central bank that can monitor some of those matters would be in exporters' interests, and i believe that that is being considered. the government can also help exporters by setting out the rules of trade clearly. many people, such as mr."
422,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nicholas Budgen,"macmillan and robert boothby, felt that during the 1930s the bank of england had imposed on the country too stringent a monetary policy, and that the independent bank of england had made the slump deeper and more ferocious than it might otherwise have been. they hoped in the post-war settlement to gain political control over the bank. it is an override power which takes account of the argument for public accountability."
423,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,"it deals with the legitimate argument about whether in our democracy, with a sovereign parliament, we should have something approaching an independent or autonomous central bank.  i now advance the general arguments for granting the bill a second reading. they get noticed and perhaps applauded; then the chattering classes say that they are a good thing; then, later, the man in the pub may take a transitory interest in them."
424,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen," it is possible that, at some later stage, pressure will be put on the bank of england to modify the judgments that it publishes in its quarterly inflation report, and no doubt some consideration will be given by the bank to the modification of that report, just as in stuart times some judges no doubt regarded themselves as no more than the handmaiden of the executive and from time to time did not support the independence of the judiciary. but that will not stop the general trend, which i suggest will lead to more stable monetary policy. if it produces an unfavourable inflation report, its prospects of successfully conducting gilt sales at favourable prices will be jeopardised."
425,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Willetts,that is one reason why many who argue in favour of giving the bank of england an independent role in monetary policy have suggested that the role of selling government debt should be taken away from it. can my hon.  i have referred to two steps in the direction that i hope the house will take by giving the bill a second reading.
426,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,"we ought not to dismiss the growing interest in the country at large in some form of independent or autonomous central bank. every week brings a new high-powered report suggesting the advantages of such a bank. it is true that there are some members of the treasury select committee who would like to see a british bundesbank, but the last thing in the world that i want is a british bundesbank."
427,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen," the proposals that i support are designed to create openness and accountability, but not as a preliminary to a free-standing independent british central bank or, even worse, to a european central bank. when the bank was independent in the 1930s, it had all the faults of the accumulated tradition of being the spokesman for the city interests.  first, if the economy picks up as we all hope it will   and there has been a major relaxation of monetary policy since 16 september 1992, so we are entitled to hope and believe that the economy has picked up and will pick up further   the consumer will save less, spend more and be less inclined to buy government debt."
428,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,"that means that the deficit of about Â£1 billion a week will be increasingly funded by foreign holders of sterling, most of whom come from countries that have independent central banks. they will find it very difficult to understand how a government can say to them on the one hand, ""please lend us Â£1 billion a week"" and on the other, ""the last thing we want is a system of more open relations between ourselves and our subordinate, the bank of england.""
 secondly, if the bill goes into committee, it will give the government a splendid opportunity to explain their present thinking about the maastricht treaty and the move towards a european central bank. and learned friend the chancellor of the exchequer said:
 we should consider it with care, also taking into account such matters as parliamentary accountability for an increasingly more autonomous bank of england.""    [official report, 16 december 1993; vol."
429,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,"234, column 1257.]
 on an earlier occasion, when the prime minister was chancellor of the exchequer, he said that he was against any form of independence for the bank of england because
 the man or woman responsible for monetary policy should be available to the house of commons to answer for his or her policies.""    [official report, 5 july 1990; vol. 175, column 1110.]
 each of those arguments is important and compelling. i have energy conservation matters that i know the government will want to discuss in detail in committee, and which the same committee will have to consider as soon as it has disposed of the necessary work on this bill."
430,1/28/1994,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith," at least the liberal democrats cannot be accused of advocating an independent central bank in response to fashion   unless, that is, we are the setters of fashion, which we like to believe we are, because we put that proposal in election manifesto commitments when it was the preserve of only a few. it has taken a spate of ex-chancellors to give the concept some respectability, which it did not previously enjoy, and dispassionate and careful analysis in a treasury select committee convinced some hon. nor is it conceivable that we could devise a british clone of the bundesbank or the ""fed""."
431,1/28/1994,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith,"the term ""independent central bank"" has become shorthand for various models in which the central bank has allocated to it the operation of monetary policy in pursuit of declared objectives and is then held to account for its effectiveness in carrying out those objectives.  the consensus in the select committee was that the remit should be price stability, but that targets, which could take account of other objectives, should be publicly set by the government, with parliamentary approval. it was a complicated process, but it arrived at a decision between people of varied points of view but with a shared belief that what we needed was a more open process in which the bank has a declared objective of stability which is open to some public modification."
432,1/28/1994,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. A. J. Beith,"that is what most people are talking about when they use the shorthand of ""independent central bank"".  none of that will affect directly the other functions of the central bank. member for wolverhampton, south-west is well known for his rigorous critique of britain's participation in anything european."
433,1/28/1994,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Beith,"he pointed out that, for many people who take his view, there would be attractions in having an independent central bank in this country, rather than our being involved in a european central bank. i take a different view. budgen) intended to produce this bill, knowing his well-known opposition to the maastricht treaty, with its great emphasis on the establishment of, first, an independent."
434,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"british national central bank as a stepping stone to a still more independent european central bank, i assumed that we would be presented with a new category of bill   a sardonic bill.  now that i have read my hon. and learned friend the chancellor of the exchequer was reported as saying in the select committee report."
435,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"he said that the idea of an independent central bank, a more independent central bank, or a central bank with power to look after at least monetary affairs, had become fashionable. lord healey made the same point to the select committee. he described the idea of an independent central bank as a gimmick."
436,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"he said that it was an apologia to be used by failed chancellors to shuffle off their responsibility onto the bank of england. most governments, starting conspicuously with the stuarts, have failed to produce price stability. even during the long period in which britain was on the gold standard and had an independent central bank, the price of wheat and the purchasing power of wages often fluctuated greatly."
437,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,that shows that price stability is an infinitely complex problem which is not susceptible to any simple or single solution. a successful economic policy requires a wide variety of interconnecting financial and economic policies constantly in need of modification in relation to each other.  i argue that to hive off control of monetary policy and interest rate movements to a so-called independent central bank would reduce our ability to co-ordinate fiscal and monetary policy.
438,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"the bundesbank is often cited as an example of an admirable independent central bank. no one denies that it has done a good job in germany or that it enjoys enormous prestige due to germany's experiences of appalling inflation in the early 1920s.  in my judgment, to give special separate monetary powers to the bank of england would tend to produce exactly the same results for britain."
439,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"my basic technical criticism of all moves towards an independent bank of england, particularly in monetary affairs, is the disadvantage of separating monetary policy from fiscal policy. the act and the art of balancing monetary and fiscal policy produces good economic performance.  any fool can create stable prices or falling prices by plunging the country into slump conditions."
440,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"that is precisely what the independent bank of england under montagu norman did during the 1920s by its obsession with the gold standard and maintaining sterling at an overpriced parity against the united states dollar. montagu norman, the governor of the day, took the view that the consequent unemployment was no responsibility of his.  i hope that my hon."
441,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,friend will not be too much taken by the arguments of those who want an independent central bank. we considered an independent central bank in the treasury select committee. some of us were initially attracted towards that and the new zealand model.
442,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"friend. it is undoubtedly the case that the great majority of the people outside the house and in the city of london   lord roll's committee produced an extremely distinguished report on the subject recently   are the same people who were so enthusiastic for britain to join the erm, who argued that we should stay in it and rejoin it, are in favour of the maastricht treaty, want us to go for a single european currency and want us to have a single, independent european central bank.  my hon."
443,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell," that incident shows that the crisis of september 1992 had honourable predecessors in our history. nothing very much changes in the practicality of the management of economic and financial affairs whether the bank of england is nationalised or independent.  most changes in interest rates in this country have, in practice, been driven by external factors, not by domestic ones."
444,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"that has happened under all governments.  the most serious blunder in monetary policy since an independent central bank persuaded churchill to return to the gold standard at the wrong dollar parity in 1925 was our decision, strongly urged by the bank of england at the time, to join the exchange rate mechanism in 1990. to join it at all was a mistake, to join it at the wrong parity to the deutschmark was a blunder and to remain within it throughout the first nine months of 1992 was a folly, as i said at the time."
445,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell," the bank of england is more or less unique in that regard. the proposition that an independent central bank need only focus on its role in monetary policy does not apply to it. conversely, giving the bank freedom in that one role but not in the rest of its wide range of roles would produce an administrative dog's breakfast."
446,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"that is what makes all these panaceas and gimmicks so fundamentally undemocratic, however much effort is made to disguise the truth by means of artificial and inevitably ineffectual devices to achieve occasional accountability.  one reason for the present level of support for a more independent central bank is the idea that monetary policy is different from other policies. it is seen as a simple technical operation with a single clear-cut objective, and with well-understood and reliable techniques of operation."
447,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell," historically, when high inflation has existed in the united kingdom, it has not been only, or even mainly, the result of lax monetary policy   except, briefly under the chancellorship of lord lawson; and that mainly reflected his mistaken exchange rate policy rather than his interest rate policy. nor have i ever heard it suggested that interest rate policy has ever been conducted for long on terms of which the bank of england disapproved, or that interest rates would have been significantly higher or lower in the past 15 years if the bank had enjoyed monetary independence over that period   although, admittedly, the bank was a good deal more sceptical about monetarism in the early 1980s under lord richardson's governorship than were the politicians, rightly in my view.  the idealised picture of monetary policy that exists in some quarters extends further to the notion of the supposed infallibility of the men who would practise it within an independent central bank."
448,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"in the same lecture to the bank of italy's centenary meeting, mr.  one does not have to look into a crystal ball when one can read the book to see what happened when the bank of england made all those monetary decisions. people sometimes forget that we had an independent central bank until quite recently."
449,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"when i first started writing essays at school about the money supply we had an independent central bank   it was not nationalised until 1946. the ""special priesthood"", to use paul volcker's mocking phrase, was epitomised by the two governors who dominated the bank of england for most of the preceding years of this century: lords cunliffe and norman. cunliffe said:
 the idea of montagu norman as governor simply terrifies me""."
450,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell, those were the men who ran the independent bank of england for virtually the first half of this century and made such an appalling mess of the british economy. they helped to bring hitler to power and brought mosley marching down threadneedle street with his blackshirts. does my hon.
451,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Duncan Smith,friend agree that it is not altogether true that the so-called independent bank of england was wholly responsible for those problems prior to the war? it was implementing a political policy. the governors were utterly contemptuous of their chancellors.
452,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"if we were to recreate the independent bank of england in the far more political and democratised atmosphere of contemporary britain, those tensions would certainly return, probably in heightened form.  we must guard against the danger of the exceptionally agreeable character of the present governor of the bank of england misleading us into building permanent institutional arrangements that will one day be operated by much less emollient people. friend the member for wolverhampton, south-west now wishes to amend."
453,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell," winston churchill had five years of unhappy experience as chancellor of the exchequer in the 1920s dealing with an independent central bank. on 16 august 1945, as leader of the conservative opposition, he made his first speech in the house after the 1945 defeat.  previously, that had been dismissed as impossible because there is so much else that affects inflation."
454,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Dr. Jeremy Bray,"to bolster the credibility of that peg, the chancellor invited the bank of england to produce what it said would be an independent report on inflation. the first inflation report was issued in february 1993 and gave the bank's view of the inflation process. the major responsibility that one leaves an autonomous government is that of managing the economy."
455,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,the bill is best understood as a paving bill for the independence of the bank of england. it is for that reason that its deviser is a hero in threadneedle street. it is to the value of increased independence and autonomy for the bank of england that i propose to address my few remarks this morning.
456,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott, i listened with some wonder to the hon. it is a matter at the centre of the political debate in britain. the first fallacy that underlies the conclusions of my colleagues on the treasury select committee and which underlies the bill is the notion that there is some automatic causal relationship between an independent central bank and a strong economy and low inflation.
457,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott," my colleagues on the treasury select committee were so enthusiastic, gently nudged by mr. it does not have an independent bank. the argument that i put to my colleagues and that i put to the house is that one cannot extrapolate from the west german experience to make a watertight model that proves that purely from the creation of an independent central bank will flow the benefits of low inflation and growth that we saw in west germany."
458,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"i am sorry, but i should like to make some progress.  the point is important because the balance of argument rests on a single pinpoint, the west german experience. i believe that one cannot, academically or intellectually, extrapolate from the west german experience and argue, as my colleagues seem to think one can, that there is a direct causal relationship between having an independent central bank and having west german standards of economic growth, and thus a west german-type strong economy."
459,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Livingstone,"the most recent example of a country moving towards having an independent central bank is, of course, russia. friend agree that that has not been a particularly good indicator of an independent central bank helping to reduce inflation? i should think that the russian experience is that not only is an independent central bank not the ideal weapon for fighting inflation, but it is not necessarily something that brings about great social cohesion and stability."
460,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott," if there is no academic basis for believing that an independent central bank automatically brings low inflation and a strong economuy, what is the overwhelming attraction of it to hon. members on both sides of the house? in that knowing french manner, mr."
461,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"camdessus put it to us that we as politicians should see the attraction of an independent central bank, because it would allow politicians to avoid the unpleasant political and democratic consequences of interest rates that are too high.  although i understand the cynical argument for not allowing people to express their anger at high interest rates by directing it at politicians, who then say ""well, it is not us; it is the governor of the bank of england"", i cannot see how anybody could argue that that would lead to an increase in democracy and accountability. politicians and commentators who argue for an independent central bank are arguing for a monetary policy that is characterised by the slogan, ""not me, guy."
462,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"go and see eddie george"".  another argument for the bill, apart from what i believe to be the totally false argument about a causal relationship between an independent central bank and low inflation, and apart from the rather cynical argument that politicians do not like to bring forward, and that is behind much of the debate on the subject, is the notion of accountability. as someone who sat thorugh almost all the evidence-taking sessions, has read the bill and is familiar with the report, let me say that the notion that, either in the recommendations of the treasury select committee or in the bill, there is any real advance towards accountability is wholly fraudulent."
463,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Ms. Abbott,"they will not give politicians, and, more importantly, the people any further direct control over monetary policy, which is so important to their lives, their jobs and their ability to pay their mortgages.  there is no academic or economic argument to suggest that there is a direct relationship between an independent central bank and inflation. the bill will not result in any huge improvement in the methods of accountability, so why are so many hon."
464,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"the notion of independence will join five-year-plans, little neddy, monetary targets and the erm: it will be seen as one of the series of failed nostrums for the underlying cause of the economy's failures.  i believe that any move towards greater independence and autonomy for the bank of england in regard to monetary policy would be anti-democratic. it would not be defensible in any economic or academic terms."
465,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies," the second reason why it is pertinent for us to discuss the subject now is the international context. only a few years ago it was exceptional for any country to have granted a central bank independence in the conduct of monetary policy. until recently, the only examples were switzerland, germany and, to a slightly qualified degree, the united states."
466,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies," thirdly, there was general acceptance of the great weight of empirical evidence that in practice there is a strong and postive correlation between the degree of independence of monetary institutions and inflation. that is so clear that the country that has given the greatest independence to its central bank, switzerland, is top of the league for monetary performance measured by price stability since the second world war. second in that league is the federal republic of germany."
467,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies,"that was the third important matter on which the committee agreed.  fourthly, the committee agreed that the bank of england is more than capable, by virtue of its world reputation and the proven confidence of the people who run it, from the governor and the court to the various departments, of playing just as effective a role as an independent central bank as the role currently played by the bundesbank and the swiss national bank. there is therefore little reason not to capitalise on those talents and on the bank's reputation and allow it to do for us what those other institutions have successfully done in their respective countries."
468,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies,"for reasons that i fully understand, my hon. friend sets out the possibility of a parliamentary override of the monetary policy being pursued by an independent bank of england. i understand the strong reasons for democratic accountability and the sovereignty of parliament that will cause many hon."
469,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies,"if parliament continually changes the indices that it is targeting, that in itself will undermine the policy's stability and credibility.  it is far better that parliament establishes that an independent bank of england has a responsibility to maintain price stability. it is then up to the bank to defend its achievement of that objective   to defend it in the markets, to public opinion, to the house, to the treasury and to the treasury select committee or to any other select committee to which the bank will, from time to time, have to give an account of itself under the bill."
470,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Davies," if we want to give the bank greater independence, we must resist the temptation to reduce that independence subsequently in practice, or we shall undoubtedly negate a large part of the purpose in which we are engaged.  the only way to ensure that monetary policy is seen as being thoroughly and definitively emancipated from short-term political pressures is to give the bank of england an entirely independent status. of course, nobody can overturn the sovereignty of parliament and, as my hon."
471,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Davies,"if the bank of england is given the monetary independence sought by my hon. friend the member for wolverhampton, south-west, should it lose any of its existing responsibilities?  secondly, there is the important question of what is meant by independence."
472,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"an examination of central banks throughout the world reveals that there is no clear pattern   indeed, the word ""independence"" is overused. some banks that are considered to be independent are more so in practice than in law, and much depends on their reputation and track record. budgen), the promoter of the bill, said, the 1:1 conversion rate on the unification of germany was determined by political factors and opposed by the bundesbank in principle, although the bank acquiesced in the event."
473,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"in that case, it could be argued that, because the question was essentially to do with exchange rates   for which ministers are responsible in germany   rather than with monetary policy   for which the bundesbank is responsible   that is not a criticism which can be levelled against the fact that the bundesbank is an independent central bank.  however, that episode illustrates the inherent tension between exchange rate policy and a policy on inflation. its governing body is appointed by the president, who is a political creature."
474,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling," many central banks are said to be independent, but have ministers sitting on their boards. canada and spain are examples of that. however, i accept that it is the perception of what is likely to happen that is important, rather than what could happen in theory."
475,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"put simply, the argument for an independent central bank is that the public trust bankers more than they trust politicians. it is a question of credibility. the fear of high inflation in germany, born of the german experience of the 1920s, is the reason why the bundesbank is probably still trusted more than german politicians."
476,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"there is no guarantee that an independent central bank in britain would remove an inflationary tendency. the performance of mr. there is something in the credibility argument, whether we like it or not."
477,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"it is a counter-inflationary force locked into the system, although it has to be said that there is no evidence that a central bank's independence is a necessary condition for achieving low inflation rates. however, from examination, it is clear that there appears to be a premium, although we do not know exactly how much it is. of course, there is the argument about causation, having regard to the political and economic culture that prevails in countries with independent central banks."
478,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling," the third criticism of the bill arises from accountability, which is crucial. beith) said, many successful independent central banks throughout the world are part of a general constitutional settlement which we do not have. the united states fed is part of the united states constitutional structure, and the bundesbank in germany is in a similar position."
479,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"members who have spoken in the debate so far have referred to the cause of an independent central bank as fashionable. i do not know whether it is fashionable or not, but i am certain that we should not rush into something until we have considered all the consequences and taken the opportunity to examine the problems that exist with the bank of england now, let alone any that may arise in the future. before i do, let us be clear that, however modest or immodest the development envisaged in the bill, it is clearly in an identifiable direction: of something called independence."
480,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"it has been qualified that it is towards a more independent monetary policy institution and a more independent central bank.  as many hon. member for edinburgh, central put it, price stability is better delivered by bankers than by politicians."
481,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"the depoliticisation of monetary policy is one of the strands of the argument that is put in favour of a more independent central bank; the other is the argument of experience   that if one looks at the experience of other countries, one concludes that a more independent institution tends to be more successful at delivering the objective of price stability.  as i have said, those are familiar arguments. furthermore, that is true, in the context not only of the maastricht debate, but of the changes that the government have made in the conduct of monetary policy since 16 september 1992."
482,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell," the publication of a report on inflation prospects by the bank of england   it is entirely the responsibility of the bank of england, and is not something agreed with the treasury   is a small step in the direction of greater independence for the bank of england on monetary policy. the decision announced in the autumn of last year by my right hon. and learned friend the current chancellor of the exchequer   that, henceforth, the bank of england would be responsible for the timing of interest rate changes   is a further step in the direction of greater independence for the bank of england."
483,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"the position currently is clear. member for brent, east (mr. livingstone) about anything to do with economic policy, but he was right to say that one of the problems for russia is the independence of its central bank."
484,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"it is clear that institutional change is seldom a panacea. members: ""hear, hear.""] before my hon. friends become too excited, let me draw an important distinction between the doctrine that institutions must earn legitimacy    which i whole-heartedly espouse   and the doctrine advanced in similar circumstances roughly 12 months ago, which states that independent central banks are in a sense inconsistent with democracy."
485,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,i do not accept that argument. what is his feeling on the principle? do the government support moves towards an independent central bank?
486,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"i detect a distinct lack of enthusiasm on the financial secretary's part, and i assume that he is speaking for the government rather than for himself. if we are to deliver price stability, the institution in charge of monetary policy has to be able to take unpopular decisions and to have them accepted in the house and outside.  to put it in plain english, how would people outside the house regard what they perceived to be as an independent central bank putting up interest rates?"
487,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"in particular, how would they regard it if, when the issue was challenged in this place, the answer given was, ""that's not a matter for me, but for eddie""?  the question that the house should ask itself is whether my hon. friend is right to characterise his bill as a modest move in the direction of central bank independence."
488,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"i think that he is understating the substantial change that would be introduced by his bill. friend has set himself. the bill is a bigger step towards an independent central bank than he has suggested, but it is not part of our case that we have clearly decided that greater independence for the bank is either impossible or undesirable."
489,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell, i have agreed with several of the views expressed by my hon. they simply have to think in terms of the quickest possible return for the investors to whom they are responsible and accountable.  let us consider the idea that is creeping forward of the independent central bank.
490,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Ken Livingstone,"i was amazed to hear the financial secretary speak about the government's open mind. now i am not surprised that people are backing off, in the tatters of the maastricht treaty, but night after night we witnessed the government whips dragooning conservative members through the lobbies to win support for a treaty which, by law, forced the british government to denationalise the bank of england. it is rubbish for the government to say, ""we are giving the matter some thought"" or, ""we are open-minded"" or, ""a bit agnostic"" when they have spent virtually the whole of this parliament so far trying to carry into law a treaty that forced them to create an independent central bank."
491,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Ken Livingstone," no doubt the prime force is that members of the house consider other nations that have had more successful economic policies and say, ""there is an independent central bank element to their success. if we could have an independent central bank we could be the same.""
 my hon. friend the member for hackney, north and stoke newington (ms abbott) pointed out the success of japan."
492,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Ken Livingstone,japan consistently ran very high inflation until it established the basis of its growth. the japanese central bank is independent. there is a much more collective form of policy-making and task-setting in terms of japanese political leadership.
493,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Ken Livingstone,"i am not surprised that a group of bankers in any society is going to be broadly sympathetic to parties of the right, and the case i have just cited is the clearest demonstration of that in recent times.  the bill is the first step towards the creation of an independent central bank. if we were to create such a bank, how would it be governed?"
494,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Ken Livingstone," it is all very well for the bill to say that the government of the day could, in effect, issue an edict that will run for six months, but what would be the impact on the money market while that was being debated in parliament? what would it cost the british government in a possible drain on the pound if it were known that, while the independent bank of england was favouring one policy, the government of the day were having a public debate and a vote in the chamber one or two or three days hence to impose a policy to which the bank was opposed? it would mean a collapse in confidence."
495,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Ken Livingstone,"that meant that if something was not going right, everyone could see where the political responsibility lay.  i have not the slightest interest in taking even one step towards an independent central bank, which will lead to a blurring of accountability and a blurring of where blame lies. as my hon."
496,1/28/1994,Labour,labour,Mr. Livingstone,"the best and brightest minds come out of our universities and go into the city    into stockbroking and accountancy   rather than into industry, engineering and scientific research. we must change that climate of opinion, and no independent central bank will do it.  if the bill became law, the message would go out that britain's financial interests had reinforced their predominance over industry in the british economy."
497,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Lady Olga Maitland," i note that the treasury committee, of which my hon. friend the member for wolverhampton, south-west is a member, admitted that it had no intention of seeking an independent bank of england, and my hon. friend emphasised that in his speech."
498,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Lady Olga Maitland,"the former chancellor of the exchequer, nigel lawson, was quoted in the economist in 1990 as saying in 1987
 i make the decisions and the bank carries them out.  a turnabout in mood, which surprised commentators, came when lord lawson, when giving evidence to the treasury select committee in an investigation into the independent role of the bank of england, said:
 i became convinced in my own mind that it would be a better institutional arrangement for the battle against inflation  ¦ it was not because i was suddenly struck with the feeling that central bankers were supermen  ¦ it was simply that i felt as an institutional arrangement it would work better.  those who work in the bank may be flattered to be called supermen."
499,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Lady Olga Maitland," he favoured a mandate from parliament, giving price stability as the objective.  on accountability, it is interesting that the select committee report noted that the prime minister, commenting on the then chancellor's support for an independent central bank, said:
 the very real concern that i have always faced is one that i believe is spread widely across the house: the need for accountability to parliament for decisions on monetary policy matters. analysis of the world's leading economies shows that there is hardly any evidence that real growth rates or unemployment performance were superior in countries with more independently constituted banks."
500,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Lady Olga Maitland,"the flip side, as pointed out by edward balls in the financial times in 1991 is that
 countries where the fear of inflation is greatest may be those that give the most independence to a central bank thus denying governments the ability to use monetary policy to stabilise the economic cycle which may actually lead to more variable output and higher unemployment.  surely what count are the decision makers. i think it is rather depressing that we are again looking for a holy grail."
501,1/28/1994,Conservative,conservative,Lady Olga Maitland,"in the end it boils down to whether we have the right policies or not, and an independent central bank isn't going to change that.  that view was echoed in the same article by mr. may i suggest that the way in which he has achieved that   by slow, steady, incremental change   is probably better than the statute that some of us proposed earlier in the year and certainly better than the move towards an independent central european bank which he has so often advocated?"
502,4/14/1994,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mrs. Maddock,"i agree that a stable economy is most important, which is why my party supports an independent central bank to achieve just that.  the conservatives have made the tax system much more unfair to middle-income and poor families. we have established an independent panel of forecasters to display a range of views about future inflation and economic conditions."
503,4/20/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Portillo," we have already set about publishing the monthly monetary report, and we have made the bank of england independent to the point that it is able to decide the timing of interest rate changes. we have made clear to the world the indicators which we will take into account before we make decisions on monetary policy. the recent impact on consumer confidence has been based not on actual experience of what tax rises are likely to bring, but on press reports and media speculation."
504,6/28/1994,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,"given the present economic situation, is the prime minister opposed to further steps to increase the independence of the bank of england? i have made my view clear that i am not at this moment in favour of further steps to increase the independence of the bank of england. the sadness of the programme is not what is in it, but what could have been in it."
505,11/16/1994,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown," we could have had a commitment to an independent bank of england; nothing would do more to assure the markets that the chancellor does not intend to risk the economy next year for conservative tax bribes before the next election. we could have had legislation on the late payment of bills, for small businesses.  inflation is low, and that is welcome."
506,11/23/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Malcolm Bruce,"we do at least have a semi-independent bank of england, which can pursue policies to try to keep inflation under control. but there is some disagreement even about the inflation target. that too increases speculation, and that is undesirable."
507,11/23/1994,Conservative,conservative,Edward Heath," if, as has been suggested, we had an independent bank of england as a regional part of a european bank, that would be different. none the less, an independent bank would not call in the press all the time and say, ""these are our views,"" any more than the federal reserve board in washington or other independent banks do.  to make sure that we achieve that target, i have backed good intentions and resolve with a number of important decisions over the past year that have strengthened the framework of policy."
509,11/29/1994,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Julian Brazier,"we have a clear divorce between the advice from the bank of england which, even more strongly in its off-the-record briefings than in on-the-record material, is clearly in favour of another rise in interest rates and the clear advice of the independent panel of forecasters that we should hold steady for a while on interest rates.  i have an interest to declare once again. he has taken an extremely brave measure in deciding that the minutes of his monthly meetings with the governor of the bank of england should be published six weeks later."
510,1/17/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Davies,"there is a precedent for that in the open market committee of the federal reserve bank in the united states, but that is a committee of an independent central bank.  it is quite unprecedented for politicians voluntarily to decide to put such constraints on their monetary policy as will inevitably follow from publishing those minutes. that can only be good, because adjustments of a lesser amplitude will then be needed to effect a given change in expectations and behaviour."
511,1/17/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Davies,we will achieve at least some of the benefits that countries with independent central banks have enjoyed as a consequence of the greater credibility with which they conduct and pursue sustained and consistent monetary policy.  i give particular credit to my right hon.  i do not agree with some hon.
512,1/17/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Legg,"members and commentators who believe that the governor and the bank of england have been given de facto independence. when the governor gave evidence to the treasury and civil service select committee, he took pride in the fact that he took the initiative in respect of the last interest rate increase. friend also has plenty of time to make his own speech."
513,2/13/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Renton," once an independent european central bank is established, that is also likely to lead to lower inflation for its members. members with the following thought. that would be a particular possibility at a time when westminster   as we read in the newspapers   is held in very low esteem and it is quite feasible that the electorate would not worry too much about power passing from this chamber over such issues as money supply to an independent central bank, on which we were represented, of course, but which would be well outside the daily reach and control of politicians."
514,2/13/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Renton,"i am sure that my hon. deputy speaker.  in conclusion, i remain opposed to referendums, as i said at the beginning of my remarks, but when we are able to put all the facts, in two or three or four years' time, about single currencies before the british people, i believe that the arguments of lower inflation, lower interest rates, higher employment due to inward investment and the value of an independent central bank may well win the day."
515,2/13/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Cash,"i do not think it matters. stated that they strongly agreed, or agreed, with that proposition. on whether britain should never permit its monetary policy to be determined by an independent european central bank, 61 per cent."
516,2/13/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Cash,"of conservative back benchers said that they strongly agreed, or agreed. for what purpose is all that taking place? is not the crucial difference between the so-called monetary union between austria and germany, or between the republic of ireland and the united kingdom, not only that they were revocable but that they retained separate central banks, separate foreign currency reserves, separate gold reserves and total independence?"
517,2/13/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bernard Jenkin,"the choice to link their currency was a decision for each of those sovereign stales, whereas that arrangement bears no relation to what is set out in the maastricht treaty, which is a legally binding irrevocable monetary union? the terms are not set in concrete. i can see many objections to an independent central bank having no popular or democratic accountability."
518,2/24/1995,Labour,labour,Mr. Banks,"i have never worried about political involvement in economic decision-making. of course, that argument will apply long after 1997.  the prime minister's second argument was that the bank of england would need to be independent."
519,2/24/1995,Independent Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,"again, he will have to explain the objections to the bank of england being independent. even more, i am sure that on wednesday he will explain the disadvantages of monetary policy being managed not merely by an independent bank of england but by an independent european bank. that is one of the points that will be made clear on wednesday by the prime minister."
520,2/24/1995,Independent Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,"the argument about being in the erm for two years applies not only to 1996 and 1997 but, as far as i can see, into the foreseeable future. the prime minister's argument about the undesirability of an independent bank of england also applies not only for 1996 and 1997 but for the foreseeable future. with permission, madam speaker, i should like to make a statement about the insolvency of the merchant bank barings."
521,2/27/1995,Conservative,conservative,The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Kenneth Clarke),"the board will need to work closely both with barings and with the singapore, osaka and tokyo exchanges. the house will recall that the board of banking supervision is chaired by the governor of the bank of england and comprises six independent members and three members appointed ex officio from the bank.  i can assure the house that i am determined that, when the full facts are known, all the appropriate lessons will be drawn and any necessary corrective steps will be taken."
522,2/27/1995,Labour,labour,Mr. Gordon Brown," all that, he said, was ""reassuring"".  in the light of what i consider to be a culture of complacency, is not a fully independent inquiry necessary, rather than simply a board of banking supervision inquiry chaired by the governor, so that   among other things   the actions of the bank of england and regulatory authorities can be examined objectively? is not it also clear that an analysis of not just the events of the past few days but the wider policy implications involved will be necessary in the inquiry?"
523,2/27/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"had the government moved to the position that we took at the time that we said, they would not have finished up in a mess.  [interruption.] what happened   which also reinforces the case for a politically independent central bank   was that lord lawson did the most damaging thing that any government could do: he joined the exchange rate mechanism at the worst possible moment, at the worst possible exchange rate and for the worst possible reason, which was to obtain a standing ovation at the conservative party conference the next day. that is no way to run the economy and, sadly, the government have failed to recognise that a commitment to a single currency   even in principle, never mind with or without an opt-out   requires an extremely rigorous economic policy, which the government have shown no real application to deliver."
524,3/1/1995,Conservative,conservative,The Prime Minister," let me reiterate the changes that need to be made. they are: locking exchange rates, agreeing a single currency, abolishing domestic currencies, making the bank of england independent and passing control of interest rates and monetary policy as a whole to an international bank, on which this country would be represented as one among many. those are the practical implications of going forward to a single currency, and the house and the country should be aware of them."
525,3/1/1995,Labour,labour,Mr. Peter Shore," the macro-economic powers which i have outlined are still available, although sometimes with great difficulty, to the british government. how can we possibly surrender them to european institutions, the most important of which   the central bank   is wholly independent of any influence from national or european governments? that is a major problem that has yet to be resolved."
526,5/11/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,"and learned friend on not having increased interest rates, for two reasons. at long last, he understands the advantages of floating exchange rates, and he demonstrates that, under our constitution, the chancellor of the exchequer must be responsible for monetary policy and that it cannot be delegated to an independent bank of england or, worst of all, to an independent central european bank. i should certainly like to echo the kind words of the hon."
527,6/21/1995,Labour,labour,Mr. Ken Livingstone,"therefore, irrespective of what was in it, i would have voted against it.  i also voted against the maastricht treaty largely because i am opposed to an independent central bank   a strong motivating force for many labour members who opposed it. i have not the slightest doubt that, whether we are in or out of europe, that issue will return in the next parliament and will have to be fought over."
528,6/21/1995,Labour,labour,Mr. Ken Livingstone,"it is nonsense to have dual responsibility carried between an unelected official and an elected official. interest rates are central to the lives of british people and accountability for those interest rates should lie in the chamber, not with an unelected official or an independent central bank. i have no problem in voting against it."
529,7/12/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,"gentleman explain a little further his proposals for extra committees within the bank of england? is he really proposing that there should be some form of independence in the bank of england, or is that just a bit of window dressing? does he agree with the government that, ultimately, any government must take political responsibility for interest rates and be responsible to the house for them?"
530,7/12/1995,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"no, i do not propose independence for the bank of england. but the demerits of the personalised system of the chancellor meeting the governor, which is the basis of setting monetary policy, without strengthening the advice to both the chancellor and the governor, has been exposed this afternoon by the chancellor's failure even to remember what the governor said to him. that is an argument in favour of political intervention, but too often chancellors cannot be relied on to take such objective measures, and their decisions have been made for short-term political reasons which cut across the economic requirements of the time."
531,7/12/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"i believe that the fact that the german economy has built itself on the basis of an operationally independent central bank is one reason for the success of germany's economic policy.  it must be understood that we are not talking about the bank of england setting policies.  we need a responsible fiscal policy, not just short-term tax cuts, which, as people know from bitter experience after the last election, would have to be reversed immediately after an election."
532,7/12/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"we need a sensible target for inflation and a reformed central bank given operational independence to enable it to pursue those targets free from short-term political interference.  we need a european policy crafted in the country's and not the tory party's interests, and we need a macro-economy which recognises the importance of investment to create a climate which can sustain public services, at a reasonable taxation level and at a reasonable share of gross domestic product. the board considers that more thorough tests would have been likely to reveal the inadequate support for the funding requests from singapore, but the 1994 audit had not been fully completed, and it will never be known whether coopers would have raised with the management the important issues which had apparently not been identified or addressed by the time of the collapse."
533,7/18/1995,Conservative,conservative,The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)," the independent members of the board of banking supervision were separately asked by me to review the role of the united kingdom regulators, particularly the bank of england, in the events leading to the collapse. the board was assisted in this inquiry by a team of accountants, lawyers and derivatives experts, all drawn from outside the bank of england.  having obtained the facts for the house and the lessons to be learned, i now commend the report to the house for study, no doubt, for debate, or for whatever else we wish to do in due course when people wish to consider this matter properly."
534,7/18/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke,"meanwhile, open inquiry, full disclosure and a hard-hitting, independent report are the best way of restoring confidence in the bank of england.  certainly we need to improve collaboration between supervisors in different countries, a process that has been well advanced by the basle committee, but this underlines the need to take it further.  on the main point of public policy, the chancellor has displayed extraordinary complacency, and the bank of england has issued a press release saying that nothing fundamental needs to be changed."
535,7/18/1995,Labour,labour,Mr. Denis MacShane,"how soon will it be before people with investments through peps or pension funds that are traded overseas have a regulatory body independent of the bank of england to oversee how banks in this country handle those investments? leaving it with the bank of england ensures that, in future, our money will be as unsafe as the bank of england. the chancellor must not put at risk any opportunity to reduce them and he certainly must not place them in danger of being pushed up."
536,11/22/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Malcolm Bruce," that is one reason why we have consistently argued for an operationally independent central bank. it is important to include and understand the adjective ""operational"". those were misjudgments and i am glad that the chancellor overruled him."
537,11/22/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Barry Legg," that also shows that the bank of england is not yet ready for independence. before one makes fundamental changes to institutions, one must be confident about those changes, and the bank of england is not in a state to be independent. for an independent bank to operate successfully, it must have a strong collegiate approach, and the bank of england is many years away from achieving that."
538,11/22/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Barry Legg," we do not need to see next week's budget to realise how strong the deflationary pressures still are in this economy. he would be looking at the budget much more from the point of view of a minister of finance, balancing the nation's books. the currency would be run by an independent bank of england, backed by commodities, becoming a true inflation-proof hard currency."
539,12/5/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Leigh," i accept that those are radical reforms, which could take five, 10, 15 or 20 years to introduce. he wrote an article with brian reddaway, who is a professor of economics at cambridge. the argument is summarised as follows:
 if, as proposed under maastricht, a single european currency were created and an independent european central bank given control over monetary policy, the arrangement would be likely to disintegrate, or require drastic reconstruction, because the results of its operation would be found intolerable""."
540,12/7/1995,Labour,labour,Mr. Shore, that is the opinion of two men of considerable distinction. gentleman's point about the bundesbank and the benefit that the bank of england would have from that separation is powerful. that must be worthy of consideration as we move towards a more independent central bank.
541,12/14/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Malcolm Bruce,"the minister knows perfectly well that i and my party favour an operationally independent central bank and believe in any case that, if we move towards monetary union, we will have to take that step. that being the case, it seems better that the bank concentrates on its role as monetary regulator, and divests itself of the role of banking regulator. member for north durham about the power of committees to take evidence, the government should commission their own clearly independent inquiry, at the very least   if they do not accept the argument   to determine whether the separation would be beneficial."
542,12/14/1995,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Malcolm Bruce," this is no pejorative criticism of arthur andersen or any consultant at all, but when the bank of england commissions a firm of consultants to look into something independently, the consultants tend to work out who the purchaser is and what kind of reply they might be looking for; it is only human nature. the report therefore inevitably falls into the category of being commissioned by the bank of england. gentleman and the house will be well aware, the whole premise is that the power is reserved for the european central bank."
543,2/12/1996,Labour,labour,Mr. Davies,"a few weeks ago, i read a rather pompous editorial   i think that it was in the independent   which suggested that it would be marvellous if the european central bank fixed interest rates for the whole economic community. how on earth can one fix one rate of interest for that whole area with its diverse economies? unless that can be achieved, the argument about cutting taxes is also about cutting services, or at least forcing people to pay for more of their education and health care straight out of their own pockets."
544,3/4/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce," we need a more long-term vision in economic policy, which is why liberal democrats believe that we should have an operationally independent central bank. that bank, tied into a single currency   i agree with the chancellor   if it were achievable, would enable sustained lower interest rates year on year than those we could manage to achieve on our own. there are 50 clauses and four protocols concerning price stability, but not one clause spells out anything about unemployment."
545,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Mr. Llew Smith," i am also interested in the position of the welsh and scottish nationalists: their pro-single currency, pro-european central bank stance, together with their dream of independence. if that should ever come about   i hope that it will not   they will immediately recognise that it is independence in name only. smith) on obtaining this adjournment debate."
546,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"i want to address my remarks to the issue of independent central banks   whether the european central bank or central banks in general.  economists like to see themselves as pursuing a scientific discipline, but more often than not it seems like a species of faith healing. a few years ago, the important remedy for the decline of the british economy was meant to be fixed exchange rates and the exchange rate mechanism."
547,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"a recurring fashion in recent years has been the fashion for independent central banks. in the context of european monetary union, it would be an independent european central bank.  i want to explode some of the myths about independent central banks   whether about the european central bank or about making our own bank of england independent."
548,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"the argument for an independent central bank is that it will be more effective in dealing with inflation   if it were a european central bank, it would be more effective on a europewide scale. that has been repeated so many times by politicians   both labour and government   and by economists, pundits and newspaper columnists that it has taken on the status of fact.  however, there is no statistical or empirical basis for the belief that simply having an independent european central bank, independent of politicians, will have any effect on european inflation levels."
549,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"in 1994, the treasury and civil service select committee, on which i have the honour to serve, considered the role of the bank of england and issues relating to independence.  our special adviser, andrew wood, said that, even where price stability was a central bank aim, there was only a weak causal connection between central bank independence and low inflation. another of our advisers said that there was no conclusive statistical evidence of a causal relationship between the status of the central bank and inflation performance."
550,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"in other words, the main empirical argument for a european central bank that is independent of politicians   that somehow it would help to keep inflation low   has no basis in fact. yet politicians and pundits, whether in the context of debates about europe or the bank of england, continue to pursue that argument.  one may ask, if that argument has no statistical basis, why people have become so fixated on the notion that a european central bank that is independent of politicians would somehow bear down on inflation."
551,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"i believe that that is simple reverse causality: because the germans, who have had an independent central bank since the war, have been so successful in keeping down inflation, people think that a european central bank would have the same effect in europe.  anyone who has studied the german economy and politics knows, however, that there are all sorts of underlying reasons why german politicians and the german public have been so willing to swallow the policies that keep inflation low. the reverse causality argument   which says that, because the bundesbank has been so successful, europe needs a european central bank that is independent of politicians   does not stand up statistically."
552,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott," moving away from the facts and figures, the chattering classes and the people who claim to know about economics reiterate constantly the idea that monetary policy is so important that it should be taken away from politicians. they claim that the temptation for politicians to debase the currency should be removed. the argument for central bank independence and for a european central bank has found some favour with those not just on the government benches but on my own side."
553,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott," in that context, i remind the house of evidence given to the committee by sir douglas wass, who, as some hon. members will know, is a former permanent secretary to the treasury. on the question of a european central bank that is independent of politicians, he said:
 it is not the job of central bankers to judge how far it is right to go in damaging the standard of living of some members of the community, or destroying the jobs of others, in order to bring inflation on to some particular path."
554,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,these are broad matters as much of social welfare as of economics.  that is the central argument against a european central bank. the statistical case that independent central banks bear down on inflation has yet to be made.
555,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"the idea that one can extract monetary policy, with all its implications for unemployment, from wider political considerations seems quite wrong; in other words, decisions to do with the exchange rate and monetary policy are too important to be left to bankers   whether they are european central bankers or our own wonderful eddie george. he said:
 it seems to us to be fundamentally mischievous for a significant element of the polity affecting these issues to be removed from the domain of a democratically elected and responsible government and handed to that of an appointed and unaccountable central bank"".  the arguments against an independent central bank   whether it is opposition to a european central bank or in opposition to giving independence to the bank of england   are clear."
556,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"there is no factual evidence to suggest that, if we had an independent european central bank tomorrow, it would be able to replicate europewide the success that the germans have had until recently in fighting inflation. it would be fundamentally undemocratic to take away from politicians and give to central bankers the important decisions that have such a wide-ranging effect on the whole community. smith) has chosen an important subject for his debate."
557,5/1/1996,Conservative,conservative,The Paymaster General (Mr. David HeathcoatAmory),"he spoke with great clarity against the concept of a independent european central bank, chiefly on the ground of what he perceived as a lack of democracy.  the functions and powers of the european central bank are defined in the treaty of rome, as amended   particularly as it was amended at maastricht   which sets out the phased introduction and the steps on the way to full economic and monetary union in the european union. we found when we entered the erm and locked exchange rates   having been told that all would be well because wages and prices would adjust   that wages and prices did not adjust, the erm exploded and we had to leave it rather ignominiously."
558,5/1/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"given that experience, what makes the minister think that wages and prices would be any more responsive within emu and under an independent european central bank? the european central bank is based on the concept of having an independent central bank with governors coming from all the central banks of the countries participating. it has a strict injunction laid on it to preserve the value of the currency and price stability, which would be essential."
559,5/16/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke,"he has found some details in the treaty. the european central bank is intended to be an independent central bank, just as germany has an independent bundesbank and the united states has an independent federal reserve. that would be important for this country if ever we contemplated making the bank of england independent, and i think that there are mixed views in this house about that."
560,5/16/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke,"it is not, however, the most critical feature of the maastricht treaty. to ask the chancellor of the exchequer what recent representations he has received urging him to make the bank of england fully independent of her majesty's government.  [33405]"
561,6/27/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Brown,"in view of that reply, and as the government have been so successful in reducing interest rates and inflation over the past few years, does my right hon. friend agree that there is absolutely no need whatsoever for an independent central bank in this country? further, will he confirm that we are not legally obliged   under our opt-out   to become part of the central banking system of the treaty on european union under stage 2 of economic and monetary union?"
562,6/27/1996,Labour,labour,Mr. Betts,the chancellor has previously said to the house that he does not believe that there will be any constitutional implications as a result of the creation of a single currency. will the chief secretary tell the house whether the transfer of powers from the government and from the house to an independent european central bank is not a significant constitutional change? will the government resist arty claims that are made for an independent central bank?
563,6/27/1996,Conservative,conservative,Terence Higgins,"i congratulate my right hon. yesterday, the governor of the bank of england said that he was uncomfortable with the current level of borrowing and that the chancellor should also be uncomfortable with it. he also indicated that interest rates would be able to come down further if we had an independent central bank."
564,7/17/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Malcolm Bruce,"in principle, the chancellor is in favour of going into a monetary union, where we would have to have an independent central bank, and his leaked document said that if we stay out we will need an independent central bank. is it not time that he made a common-sense decision about it?  my party and i welcome several aspects of the report."
565,7/17/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"it said that, whatever course of action this country takes in relation to monetary policy and monetary union, we should have   and would need   an independent central bank sooner rather than later. the report argues that if we join the single currency we shall, by definition, sign up to the european central bank. if we stay out, having qualified, we must have our own independent central bank so as to reassure the markets that we will behave in a responsible fashion."
566,7/17/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce," that view was also articulated clearly by the governor of the bank of england. as an independent central banker, he would be bound to say that. however, he made two further points."
567,7/17/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"there are strong, sound economic arguments and benefits.  it is interesting to note that the most resistance to the idea of an independent central bank comes from the right of the conservative party and the left of the labour party. that is because they want to interfere in the economy on a day-to-day basis for political reasons."
568,7/17/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"gentleman completely misunderstands what an independent central bank is about. the decisions that he mentioned are policy decisions, which would continue to be determined by the government and by parliament. an independent central bank is about the day-to-day administration of a policy set by parliament and by the government."
569,7/17/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"out of 15 member states in the european union, we are the only one that operates in this way, and the only one that has not had consistently low inflation or consistent patterns of growth. member for gordon (mr. bruce) that i am rather concerned about his apparent fixation with an independent central bank."
570,7/17/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Richard Spring,"it strikes me as irrelevant for liberal democrats to alight on such a policy when they are entirely committed to a politically and economically integrated europe. notwithstanding the interest with which the hon. gentleman spoke of the establishment of an independent central bank, it would prove irrelevant if his party's policies were ever carried out."
571,7/17/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Richard Spring," last week, something of seminal importance happened in this country. no sound economic base has been created.  now, everyone is clutching the gimmicky idea that things will be alright if we have an independent central bank and that all the problems will be solved if we give powers to bankers with no democratic accountability."
572,7/17/1996,Labour,labour,Mr. Ken Livingstone,"i do not believe that that will happen. the advice of an independent central bank, whether it is the federal reserve in america, the bundesbank in europe or eddie george   who, fortunately, is not too independent   is always cautious and conservative and will always favour finance over industry. i see no logic in an established democracy saying that those key and vital decisions, which affect everyone's lives, should be taken out of the politically accountable arena."
573,7/17/1996,Labour,labour,Mr. Ken Livingstone," the liberals are openly in favour of that idea, and i detect one or two worrying phrases in the new labour policy document about our policy on it. if labour front-bench members think that the majority of labour members agree with them about an independent central bank, they have another think coming. from my conversations with labour members, i can tell them that the majority do not support the idea of an independent central bank."

575,10/23/1996,Labour,labour,Mr. Roy Hughes,we shall therefore need to assess carefully the european implications of such policies. would lower interest rates find favour with the independent central bank proposed by the luminaries of the european union?  i make no apologies to the house for spending so much of my speech on the subject of unemployment.

577,10/30/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Malcolm Bruce," [interruption.]
 i hear mutterings from below the gangway to the effect that the governor and the bank of england have been wrong in the past.  this independence would remove the premium that we all have to pay for political interventions. in other developed countries operating with independent central banks, long-term interest rates are persistently and consistently lower than ours."
578,10/30/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Malcolm Bruce,"the costs to our public sector borrowing and to private investors who must pay these premium rates in the united kingdom are high. it is the year when the decisions of early 1988 will be taken on board. it is also the year during which parliament will have to vote on whether to make the bank of england independent in line with the maastricht decisions, with a view to us going into an independent european central bank."
579,10/30/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"that being so, the arguments that we should not be discussing these matters now because they are a long way ahead of us are simply tosh. bruce), the liberal democrat spokesman on these matters, produced as liberals are wont to do, the orthodox view of an independent bank of england. gentleman suggested that it would be a magical elixir that would be the cure for britain's long-standing economic decline."
580,10/30/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"the orthodoxy relating to an independent bank of england is not exactly the fact. the issue will have to be debated next year. there is a case for an independent bank of england, and one that bears more scrutiny than fashionable opinion has bothered to give it."
581,10/30/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott, there are right hon. martin woolf of the financial times has said that a european central bank would be the most powerful and politically unaccountable bank in the world. it is the political unaccountability of both an independent bank of england and a european central bank on which the house should focus tonight and in future debates.
582,10/30/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott," much of the argument, inasmuch as people argue rather than make assertions in a fashionable way, for an independent bank of england, rests on the notion that there is a causal relationship between an independent bank and low inflation. the treasury committee considered the issues before the hon. we found that the factual evidence for a causal relationship was slender."
583,10/30/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"there is a relationship: as fashionable opinion always says, germany has historically had low inflation since the war and it has an independent central bank, but i always argue   the advisers and the information available to the select committee back me up   that to find the roots of germany's low inflation one has to look at germany's searing experience of hyper-inflation in the 1930s and immediately after the second world war and at a political consensus between management and labour to take inflation seriously. i challenge any of the fashionable pundits to come up with some academic evidence to show that there is a genuine causal relationship between an independent central bank and low inflation.  andrew wood, our specialist assistant to the select committee, said: whilst the relationship between inflation and central bank independence is undisputed, it is generally acknowledged that that relationship may not be causal""."
584,10/30/1996,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"quite simply it is not their job: it is the proper responsibility of the elected representatives of the democracy and should stay with them.  i now leave the question of an independent central bank, but the house will have to return to it. far from it being a remote debate at the end of the millennium, the matter will be debated on the floor of the house within 12 months."
585,11/26/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Martin,"the facts cannot be massaged away.  secondly, they must explain how we would make the bank of england independent next year   which is another necessary precondition under the treaty   and, thirdly, how on earth they will sell the idea to my constituents, via a referendum or some other means. how will they explain to those who are already exasperated by the powers of the european union institutions that those institutions will decide vital economic and political policies rather than our present economic and political system, including   quintessentially   our parliament?"
586,12/3/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"member for carshalton and wallington (mr. forman) is fond of asking for the explanation, so i should tell him that it continues to be our contention that the complete independence of the united kingdom reserve bank, as we would like to call it   the bank of england as it is now called   would contribute towards bringing down interest rates and consequently reducing the cost of borrowing by a worthwhile amount. we pay a premium for the privilege of allowing politicians to interfere with interest rates on a day-to-day basis."
587,12/3/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"the environment is being used as an excuse for taking more money out of people's pockets. the european central bank will be an independent bank, such as that which they have had for years in the united states of america and they had in the federal republic of germany. it will be responsible for monetary policy decisions."
588,12/11/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke,"hurd) and for kingston upon thames took part in the negotiations. the british negotiators took the key role in ensuring that the european central bank would be independent, that price stability would be its goal, that convergence criteria would apply and that only genuinely convergent countries would go ahead to join stage 3.  by staying involved since 1991, we have continued to exercise a key influence."
589,12/11/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"the absence of that facility has contributed significantly to the much more constant and sustainable growth that, for example, germany has achieved.  having said that, i believe that whether britain opts in or out, we should be considering moving the central bank from its position of current transparency to genuine operational independence. that needs to be done whether or not britain joins in the first wave of monetary union."
590,12/11/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce," even if we decided to stay out in the first wave, we would presumably continue to monitor our position and, effectively, remain an applicant. sooner or later, we would by treaty be obliged to create an independent central bank, but in any case the markets would be highly suspicious of an economy that had qualified for monetary union and then refused to join it.  therefore, it would be highly desirable for us to give a clear signal to the markets that we are not going to take advantage of the position in an irresponsible way and that, as a measure of our good faith, we are going to make our central bank independent."
591,12/11/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"i suggest to front-bench teams that it would be extremely beneficial if both could pledge to the house today   although, disappointingly, i do not expect them to do so   that the operational independence of our central bank will be in the next queen's speech, whoever wins the election.  the chancellor made a good case for keeping britain's option open on monetary union, but unfortunately he made it   this was apparent from the opposition benches   against the background of a party that has already closed its mind. that is an argument not for being at the heart of europe but for having nothing to do with the single currency."
592,12/11/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Norman Lamont," far from being afraid, britain should welcome the opportunity to go it alone in monetary affairs and to set an example of what can be achieved with an independent bank of england and a competitive, deregulated economy, especially to create jobs for the unemployed.  the europeans support monetary union on the basis of politics, not economic analysis. i shall also be blunt."
593,12/11/1996,Labour,labour,Mr. Tam Dalyell,i would be relaxed   but some of my colleagues would not   about the condition for an independent bank of england. i do not see that as a bogey or as an impediment to a labour government. friend have made specific points with which i agree.
594,12/12/1996,Labour,labour,Mr. Terry Davis," what we mean by an independent central bank is that it will be independent of political control. whatever criticisms we may have of the chancellor's economic policies, the fact is that if we had had a totally independent bank of england in recent months, we would have had higher interest rates.  i am in favour of a labour government having the ability to control interest rates and exchange rates, or at least to affect them."
595,12/16/1996,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tim Renton,"following dublin, does he agree that, whatever the contents of a stability pact, without general and well-informed consent to joining economic and monetary union, a single currency may well prove fragile? on that basis, would he consider asking the bank of england, which last week issued a booklet to businesses, to write an independent plain man's guide to the single currency and economic and monetary union, setting out the advantages and disadvantages for the ordinary family, and to send a copy to every household in the land? the student loan book does not affect the maastricht criteria, but the mod sale might."
596,1/14/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce, we could do more. for several reasons we should introduce proposals to make our central bank independent. i will not answer that.
597,1/14/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce," we need to get borrowing under control. the time is becoming ripe for establishing an independent central bank as a means of helping to bring borrowing down, not least because it would help to reduce interest rates, which would have wider benefits.  i welcome the fact that in yesterday's financial times the labour party indicated that it was moving in that direction."
598,1/14/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"as a precondition, however, labour wants the governor of the bank of england to insist publicly on an election-losing increase in the interest rate, which suggests that the ability to stand back and not to interfere is not built into labour's thinking. that is not the role of an independent central bank.  on interest rates, the government may be on the horns of a dilemma, as the national interest and the conservative party interest clash."
599,1/14/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,"the most important weapon of economic management being controlled by a monetary policy committee that is not held responsible by the chancellor and for which the chancellor is not responsible either to the cabinet or to the house of commons is, i suggest, a constitutional monstrosity.  it is no good labour saying that it wants the committee because it wants to move part of the way towards a single currency in europe, and therefore wants to be able to say that it is in favour of an independent central bank for domestic reasons as well as for what i would call european reasons. it is the essence of the way in which we control the economy that the chancellor takes decisions on monetary policy, and these cannot be shuffled off to a new committee."
600,1/14/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Budgen,"that was a result of properly exercised political decisions by successive chancellors of the exchequer. these decisions cannot be shuffled off to a new-style monetary committee or to an independent european central bank. if labour thinks that it can shuffle off those important decisions over our most important weapon of economic management, it is deeply wrong and it will come to learn that it has made a terrible mistake."
601,2/13/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Malcolm Bruce,"will the chancellor of the exchequer acknowledge that his inability to forecast vat receipts correctly is a significant factor in his inability to get borrowing down? unless the situation has improved, does he accept that one way that would immediately help to bring down the cost of borrowing would be to make the bank of england independent and, as a result, reduce the base of interest rates by between 0.5 and 0.75 per cent. and government debt by Â£1.4 billion this year, according to the library?"
602,2/13/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke,"we have in hand the task of getting right the estimates of receipts, although it will always be difficult.  with regard to making the bank of england independent, i believe that the present arrangements work extremely well. i find myself subjected to more debate than we used to have on the subject, because i made the process transparent by ending treasury editing of the bank's inflation report and by publishing regular minutes."
603,2/20/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Rod Richards,"that is not independence. to be a truly independent state, wales would need to have its own currency, its own central bank and a government free to determine their own interest rates, borrowing requirement, taxation, expenditure and so on. plaid cymru's model denies wales those essential freedoms."
604,5/14/1997,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister," i want this government to be long-termism in action. there is no better example of that than the chancellor of the exchequer's decision, announced last tuesday, to give the bank of england independence in the setting of interest rates. governments should not be able to play politics with people's mortgages, and the move is both right and long overdue."
605,5/14/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,"the measures include incorporation of the european convention on human rights   but what do the government mean by saying, ""just the main provisions""?   the general teaching council for teachers, the independent food standards agency, a statutory right to interest on late payment of debt, independence for the bank of england   the list goes on. it is said that the government are enacting their manifesto."
606,5/14/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Radice," i should like to mention three other matters, the first of which is the bank of england. i strongly support a bill to give the bank of england operational independence. the action is a bold move   which was certainly foreshadowed for anyone who read our manifesto   and will do much to reinforce economic stability."
607,5/14/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Radice,"moreover, the action is supported by two former conservative chancellors of the exchequer, and is based on the report of the previous parliament's treasury select committee   of which i was a member, although conservative members formed the majority.  i think that allowing the bank of england operational independence will improve control of inflation, because countries with independent central banks tend to do better on inflation. it will provide long-term protection and perspective to the government, and it will give them to time to develop and implement their policies."
608,5/14/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Cash,"that government should set their own priorities and targets and, within that framework, give the people of this country good government. they should not be passing the buck to some people in frankfurt or to an independent governor of the bank of england.  if one were to take the new zealand model, which has not been mentioned today, i might have some sympathy with the idea."
609,5/14/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Cash,"in germany, and to some extent in the united states, there are degrees of relative independence, but that is a world away from what is contained in the provisions for a central bank. those provisions mean that the bank would be completely independent and unaccountable and that we would lose the right to make the decisions that belong to the people who elected us on 1 may. they enable many small businesses to survive."
610,5/15/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Fabricant," labour ministers may claim that the independence of the bank of england was foreshadowed in the manifesto; others would argue that it was not. various models have been offered as success stories of independent banks in other countries, yet the most truly successful independent bank, the federal reserve in the united states of america, owes its success to the directive issued to alan greenspan not just to keep inflation low   that may involve putting up interest rates   but to aim for full employment.  before i turn to those proposals in more detail, it would be wrong to let this debate on the constitution pass without noting that the government have already created three separate controversies over parliamentary and constitutional matters in their first two weeks in office."
611,5/16/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. William Hague,"the first was the decision by the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer to give independence to the bank of england without waiting to inform the house of their decision or even holding a meeting of the cabinet.  what would the secretary of state have said, as the opposition chief whip in the previous parliament, if the previous government had made a decision of such fundamental importance without making a statement on the floor of the house of commons to announce it?  i should like to ask the chancellor a few straightforward questions on his statement."
612,5/20/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Kenneth Clarke,"what does he think he achieved, two weeks ago, by announcing the operational independence of the bank of england, before he came to the house to make today's statement? what advantage was there in trailing by two weeks a dramatic change in accountability to the house of those who decide united kingdom monetary policy? does he agree that, if he had simply waited for two weeks, he would have succeeded   at least a little   in concealing the government's triumphalism in their huge majority and the danger, which is already visible, of their becoming contemptuous of parliament and its procedures?"
613,5/20/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Kenneth Clarke," will the chancellor also explain to us why, before the general election, he said that he would consider giving the bank of england operational independence only after it had established a good track record of success in such matters? he repeated that statement as recently as february 1997.  on the bank of england, does the chancellor accept that the current inflation level, to which we both attach importance, is the result of decisions on monetary policy taken two years ago   when the bank of england was wrong, i was right, and he was silent about his judgment on the subject?"
614,5/20/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Kenneth Clarke,"does he accept that the timing of his decision on the independence of the bank of england very nearly coincided with production of the bank's most recent quarterly inflation report   which was wrong, by claiming that, later this year, inflation would fall to 2.5 per cent.? we now know that the inflation had fallen to 2.5 per cent. i shall take no lectures."
615,5/20/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"we have taken swift action on the misselling of pensions, the structure of the financial regime and the operational independence of the bank of england.  it ill befits the shadow chancellor to criticise the appointment of mr. did he not say in 1993 that he had an open mind on this issue, not a closed mind?"
616,5/20/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"did he not say in an interview on ""breakfast with frost"" at the beginning of the year that right-wing parties throughout the world supported the independence of central banks? does he not understand that his well-known enthusiasm for the european community means that, if there was to be economic and monetary union, there would have to be an independent central bank?  let me remind the right hon."
617,5/20/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"and learned gentleman also of the statements that have been made in the centre for policy studies' conservative agenda pamphlet, which recommends:
 give the bank of england its independence, and a statutory responsibility for meeting certain targets in terms of inflation and economic growth  ¦ remove the political risk premium on interest rates  ¦ the bank will  ¦ need reform. the current autocratic structure gives the government too much power  ¦ interest rate decisions should be taken by a council"". finally, will he agree, in the new spirit of audit which abounds in the treasury, to have his work in this area audited by independent economists?"
618,5/20/1997,Scottish National Party,Others,Mr. Alex Salmond,"does the chancellor accept that, although of course there are advantages in having an operationally independent central bank, there are also dangers if the monetary policy objectives are set too tightly? therefore, when he talks about the monetary policy objective being price stability, does he mean literally zero inflation or the 2.5 per cent. as a result of our announcements on monetary policy, long-term interest rates started to fall."
619,5/20/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"the opposition's position on the matter is not clear, but they should look at the figures and make a reasoned judgment when they receive in the house of commons the bill to give operational independence to the bank of england.  before the end of today's debate, which will take place after the statement, the shadow chancellor should answer this question: would he repeal a bank of england reform act that gave operational independence to the bank of england? if he cannot say he would, all his complaints are simply synthetic."
620,5/20/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Kenneth Clarke,"i beg to move, as an amendment to the address, at the end of the question, to add:
 but humbly regret that there is no mention in the gracious speech of the healthy economic climate in the country with rising living standards, low inflation, public finances moving towards balance and further falls in unemployment; deplore the government's granting of operational independence to the bank of england without any parliamentary debate or statement; and urge the government not to sign the social chapter, introduce a minimum wage, or to damage the united kingdom's flexible labour market in any way by adopting european labour and social legislation.  i repeat my congratulations to the right hon. bruce), the spokesman for the liberal democrats, when he said that he believed in an independent central bank, when all three of us appeared together on the platform and on television programmes."
621,5/20/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke,"that policy was not in the labour party's manifesto. and learned gentleman's confidence in his own judgment on interest rates. has he noted that two of his predecessors, nigel lawson and norman lamont, now argue for operational independence of the bank of england?"
622,5/20/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke,"that was always put to me before.  of course, interest rates have to be set high enough to achieve the inflation target, but they should also be kept as low as possible to achieve maximum growth, investment and employment. what will it mean for the man or woman in the street if my fears are right and the suddenly established independent operational committee in the bank of england raises interest rates higher than would otherwise be necessary to hit the inflation target?"
623,5/20/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke,"for the man in the street, it will mean not only higher mortgage rates, but lost investments, lost jobs and lost consumer demand. just wait. i am grateful to the new labour members for listening so attentively to my words, some of which will be burned upon them in two years as a result of the government charging ahead with policies such as the independence of the governor of the bank of england, a tax-raising budget and sticking to tory spending plans, which i am sure does not fill every labour back bencher with delight."
624,5/20/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke,"the chancellor is not even doing that correctly. it is not good enough for the shadow chancellor to say that we must not judge the markets' response on the actions of the first couple of days. their decisions are taken on the basis of judgments on what the long-term underlying rate of interest will be, and it is clear that the markets' judgment is that it will be lower; that has been the experience of all countries that have an operationally independent central bank."
625,5/20/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"the benefit of that approach is that the large national debt that has been bequeathed to the new government by the outgoing conservative government will at least be cheaper to service if long-term interest rates are lower.  these are certainly the key issues facing the government, and i am encouraged to find them given such prominence in the queen's speech.  the chancellor's decision to grant some independence to the bank of england is critical."
626,5/20/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Robert Sheldon,"i see that decision in the context of economic and monetary union.  the question for us, then, is to adjust to the clear expectation and determination of those countries which are throwing in their lot with emu. on that basis, i understand the government's decision to grant some sort of independence to the bank of england."
627,5/20/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Robert Sheldon,"i do not believe that the bank's record has been above criticism. that is why, within days of taking office, the chancellor took the actions that he did. there can be no clearer signal of our determination to fight inflation than to give the bank of england operational independence to set interest rates while increasing the accountability of the bank's decision making, as the chancellor made clear in his statement."
628,5/20/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Prescott,the fact that there was an immediate fall in long-term interest rates shows the wisdom of that decision. friend the chancellor of the exchequer. one announcement concerned the operational independence of the bank of england.
629,5/21/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Ross Cranston,"the main opposition party has taken issue with that on the basis that the decision was taken without parliamentary debate or statement, but it is in the nature of such things that events move quickly.  i hope that before the house adjourns it will take into account the various matters that i have mentioned. having fought the general election on a platform of no hundred days of dynamic action   the definition of dynamic action changing from one prime minister to another   having introduced a queen's speech with 26 bills, much to the delight of the public, having made the bank of england independent, having severed supervision of the banking system from the bank of england and having introduced a new system of regulation for the city of london, can the prime minister tell the house what he proposes as an encore?"
630,6/2/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies,"just a few weeks into the new parliament, are we not witnessing a quite disturbing situation   a new government who find it impossible to resist the undoubted temptation presented by a large majority to treat this house with increasing levity?  we have already had the unilateral decision to change the arrangements for prime minister's questions, reducing from six to three the number of questions a week that the leader of the opposition can ask the prime minister. we have already had a very important announcement about giving the bank of england operational independence being made outside this place, and we were simply presented with a fait accompli."
631,6/2/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies," now, we have the double event of a bill being guillotined which is, first, a major constitutional bill and, secondly, one that has not even started its committee proceedings. instead of going in at the right rate, however, we went in at a politically convenient time   the day before a conservative party conference   to secure a headline about a reduced interest rate, and we paid a heavy price for that political opportunism. as a matter of detail, one reason why the liberal democrats called for operational independence for the bank of england was so that such decisions would not be taken in that way."
632,6/9/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"that was not in the labour party manifesto, but it is now in the government's programme. friend for her intervention. she overlooks the fact that the cbi welcomed the steps that we took to give the bank of england independence, to establish the monetary committee and to separate regulation from the bank so that it can concentrate on its core function, the delivery of the inflation target set by the government."
633,6/9/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Robinson,"it is no good trying to get away from the central basis for what we need: stability and steady, sustainable growth. the announcement by my right hon. friend the chancellor of the exchequer about the independence of the bank of england on interest rates had such a rapturous welcome that it is with some diffidence that i rise to attempt to put a reasoned case against that independence."
634,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott," the universal acclaim from pundits, commentators and the rest of the chattering classes with which independence for the bank was greeted reminded me of nothing so much as the universal acclaim that greeted our entry into the exchange rate mechanism some years ago   and we all know what happened to that.  first, we cannot decouple economic management from politics. secondly, the academic arguments for an independent central bank are built on sand, intellectually."
635,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"thirdly, the idea is fundamentally undemocratic. i represent one of the poorest constituencies in the country, with one of the highest levels of unemployment, so the house will understand that, ultimately, my concern is about growth and jobs.  there can be no doubt that independent central banks are the fashionable thing, not only with british commentators and pundits but internationally."
636,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"since the late 1980s, more than 25 countries, from france to kazakhstan and from new zealand to pakistan, have opted for independent central banks, so there is no doubt that the chancellor is in the vanguard of fashion.  however, with some reluctance, i must tell the house that there is a gaping chasm between what economic theory suggests central bank independence might do and what the empirical evidence shows it can do. despite the universal assumption among journalists and some of my hon."
637,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"friends that an independent central bank necessarily leads to low inflation, the academic research suggests that, although there may be a statistical relationship between central bank independence and low inflation, no causal relationship can be established.  that point is so important that the house will forgive me if i linger for a few minutes on the academic arguments. in 1993, the treasury select committee conducted a major inquiry into the idea of independence for the bank of england."
638,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"our report records that our then specialist adviser, andrew wood, reviewing the academic literature, concluded:
 some general conclusions can be drawn from this review of the literature:   there is a statistical relationship showing that on average countries with independent central banks achieve lower inflation than countries with dependent central banks. there is no conclusive statistical evidence of a causal relationship between the status of the central bank and the inflation performance"". friends will call this in aid, as always."
639,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott," furthermore, another major study in 1991 by grilli, macciandaro and tabellini showed that the three most independent central banks had the lowest inflation. but that is not the sum total of academic work, although one might believe it is from listening to some of the eddie george groupies in the house.  there is other and more recent academic work on the subject."
640,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"i draw the house's attention to the studies of adam posen, an economist from the new york federal reserve, who said that central bank independence was a consequence of pressure from the financial sector. he said:
 central bank independence arises from the desires of an interest group   
 the financial sector   
 that is more committed to price stability than the average voter.  michael jenkins of hull university said in his research on the subject that, if one factors out other structural factors tending to low inflation   for instance, the corporatist wage bargaining of west germany   there is no statistically significant relationship between higher central bank independence and low inflation."
641,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"gerard lyons, chief economist of the japanese bank dkb, has said that the evidence that bank independence guarantees low inflation is slim. in 1993, blake and westway said that a central bank pursuing its own goals with no regard for the social welfare function is frequently harmful.  the first point i am anxious to make is that, just because central bank independence is associated with low inflation   i do not deny that   does not mean that it causes low inflation."
642,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"that is the weakness of the argument used by my hon. friends who are in favour of independence. i maintain something different   that, contrary to popular belief, an independent central bank does not create a culture of low inflation, but is a reflection of a culture of low inflation."
643,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"the distinction may seem pedantic or trifling to some of my hon. friends, but it is the key distinction.  when people come to argue for an independent central bank, they always pray in aid the bundesbank and germany's economic record, and there is no doubt that the bundesbank is the arnold schwarzenegger of monetarism."
644,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"the bundesbank has practised a form of macro-monetarism for longer than any of us here can remember.  let us linger on the german case, which proponents of independence always cite. the belief that the fact that germany has an independent central bank and also has low inflation is an argument for independent central banks elsewhere is a simple case of reverse causality."
645,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"i put to the house the following proposition   the reasons for germany having low inflation are much more fundamental, and partly rooted in its history.  immediately after the war   and in the ruins of a defeated germany   the country once again experienced hyper-inflation. otmar issing, chief economist of the bundesbank, has said:
 it is no coincidence that it is the germans with their experience of two hyperinflations in the 20th century who have opted for an independent central bank which is committed to price stability."
646,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott," there are other structural reasons why germany has low inflation, one of which is the underlying strength of the german economy this century. that is the real economy of germany, not some short-term monetary fix leading to a low-inflation environment. i would argue that the academic evidence for an independent central bank is simply not soundly based, and i urge my hon."
647,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"friends to go back and review the academic evidence. i do not want to embarrass colleagues who believe that the party has no history, but the 1945 manifesto reflected this country's experiences of the 1930s. in the 1930s, we had an independent central bank, and its name was montagu norman."
648,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"i sometimes think that my colleagues who favour an independent central bank should get t-shirts saying, ""come back, montagu norman   all is forgiven.""
 in the 1945 manifesto, labour said about the 1930s:
 great economic blizzards swept the world in these years. the great inter-war slumps were not acts of god or of blind forces. it is also almost irreversible."
649,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"of the 20 frequently cited studies on central bank independence, only one associates it with growth. guy debelle and stanley fischer said:
 since 1962, countries with independent central banks have suffered deeper recessions on average than those without.  mark hutchison and carl walsh found the same in a study of new zealand."
650,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Lawrence Cunliffe,"friend will be interested in the response from industry since the chancellor declared the independence of the bank of england. in my part of the world, the largest industrial region in the north-west, the bosses are backing labour: in the latest poll of industrialists, 88 per cent. sir bryan hopkin and sir douglas wass, in evidence to the treasury and civil service select committee in 1993, said:
 it is not desirable, or indeed even possible, to earmark particular instruments to particular objectives as if they had no wider repercussions."
651,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott," one of the most important arguments against an independent central bank concerns accountability. i do not accept the argument that monetary policy is a neutral instrument outside politics that is too difficult and arcane to be handled by politicians. member for hackney, north and stoke newington (ms abbott) said, but she deserves credit for having brought an important issue   probably the most important decision that the government have yet made   to the attention of the house."
652,6/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable," i shall briefly rehearse the central arguments why central bank independence is important and why so many governments have followed that policy. the first is the need for an institution that is clearly and unambiguously committed to low and stable inflation. it is now universally accepted, in europe and the anglo-saxon world, including new zealand and the united states, and in south america and russia, that governments need a bulwark against inflation."
653,6/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable,"independent central banks provide that.  the reason why it is important for central banks not to suffer day-to-day political intervention is that it is difficult for such intervention to be successful, because of the long lags in economic policy. they   or, rather, their predecessors   should have acted in advance of inflation appearing."
654,6/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable,"that is what a technically based, independent central bank can do.  the second basic reason why independence is important relates to interest rates. individuals suffer, and the national debt is inflated unnecessarily by high interest rates."
655,6/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable,"an independent central bank should get those down, as we saw from the market reaction to the chancellor's announcement a few weeks ago.  we need to achieve a climate of long-termism in british industry. it is not in the nature of capitalism to be short-term: it is the way that our policy has been conducted."
656,6/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable," independent central banks have a general problem with accountability, which was the core of the argument by the hon. member for hackney, north and stoke newington. however, it is important to stress that it is a necessary rather than a sufficient condition for good economic policy."
657,6/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable,"if the government were to allow the bank of england to operate independently and to pursue an austere approach to the management of money while not disciplining their fiscal policy, we would quickly experience high interest rates, appreciating sterling and considerable damaging side effects. a necessary corollary of the government's actions on the monetary front is a similar discipline on fiscal policy. will hutton in the guardian said that it was part of a process of modernising the british state."
658,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Stephen Timms,"i noticed that he also said:
 advocate bank of england independence, and it's never long before
 montagu
 norman  ¦ is being used to scare us witless of the perils and dangers ahead.  as my hon. we do not need that; we need stability instead."
659,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Stephen Timms,"that is why the commission on public policy and british business proposed that the government should
 give independence to the bank of england to achieve the target through the control of interest rates""   
 quite rightly making the point that the dangers of instability are particularly acute for a labour chancellor.  instability has crippled labour governments in the past, so that all their energy has been consumed in fighting one economic crisis after another. in my view, it will stop politicians such as the former chancellor cutting interest rates just before a party conference so that he could go on stage to brag, and then putting them back up according to political whim."
660,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Ivor Caplin,that is why the bank of england's independence to set interest rates is important.  that decision has generated confidence in the business community. member for twickenham.
661,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Denzil Davies,"he offered us a clear exposition of how central bank independence would solve so many of our problems. at the end of his speech, however, a note of doubt crept in. that was a jolly good treasury document, which gave a really good assessment and enabled us to understand how the inflation target was to be set."
662,6/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Michael Jack,"the government believe in openness, but there must be openness on both sides; it is no use having only the minutes from the newly independent bank of england to look at   we want to know the treasury's view, because it is also part of the monitoring process.  when i asked about how the chancellor would resolve any difference of opinion between the governor and chancellor on the government's objectives for growth and employment   both unspecified   and the achievement of price stability, i was again told, ""watch this space for the mansion house speech."" it will have to be a hell of a speech if it is to answer all those questions. we have seen germany, with its independent bank, trying to deal with the german economy and the strictures of inflation getting in the way of the sound of the unemployed crying for the economy to be expanded."
663,6/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Michael Jack,"we have yet to test the difficult decisions resulting from having an independent bank of england.  when i asked how we will identify the numerical targets of the government's economic policies, so that we can monitor what is happening, the reply again referred me to the mansion house speech.  we are owed much more information about how, for example, the inflation target is to be set."
664,6/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Michael Jack,if the chancellor of the day wants to manipulate the bank of england   for all its independence   he can choose a lax inflation target and so give us low interest rates.  we have heard nothing from the chancellor about what he thinks will be the potential for inflation in the british economy. friend's sterling work on the treasury select committee.
665,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell),"she has pursued a distinctive line on central bank independence and we acknowledge her commitment to that. when i was doing some background reading of the select committee's reports in preparation for the debate, i noticed that my hon. friend the member for east ham said, it is the poorest in society who suffer from high inflation."
666,6/11/1997,Labour,labour,The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell),"a considerable amount of academic work has been done since the treasury select committee report on an independent central bank. there is considerable evidence of a relationship between an independent central bank and low inflation. as the bank of england's highest wisdom in any situation is to put up interest rates   it has already done so, despite the fact that real interest rates are at a record level and the pound is substantially overvalued   is not the bank preparing the way for a manufacturing contraction, a rise in unemployment and a fall in growth next year?"
667,6/12/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Mitchell,"if we are to have an independent central bank, should not the government at least appoint an expansionist governor, and is the minister aware that the shadow chancellor might well be available for the job next week? i am grateful to my hon. friend the member for great grimsby on this point   we have to maintain a low inflation policy."
668,7/2/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Denis MacShane,"there are virtues in creating the independent monetary policy committee for the bank of england. i do not want our chancellor, or in 20 years' time some conservative chancellor, waking up worrying about interest rates every morning of his life. the united states, which probably cleaves to many of the values about which my hon."
669,7/2/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Denis MacShane,"friend spoke, has an independent central bank. one could enter into the debate elsewhere. if there is spiralling inflation because of ever devaluing exchange rates, they are reduced to financial jiggery-pokery instead of dealing with the real elements of their business success."
670,7/2/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Davey,"that is why an independent central bank is a good idea, and a good policy for manufacturing industry. it would set a stable framework for our macro-economic policy and help the government in their attempts to bear down on inflation over the long term. for that, a great tribute must be paid to him."
671,7/2/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown," if we have a chancellor who can exercise that judgment, it is much better left in the hands of the chancellor and the treasury than in the hands of an independent panel comprising the governor of the bank of england and other experts. on the other hand, if we have a chancellor who is not sure of his judgment, the decision will be handed over to the bank and an independent panel of experts. the chancellor made no mention of the opportunity cost to the british economy that is related to our contributions to the european union."
672,7/2/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. John Wilkinson,"nor did he go in depth into the implications for the sovereign running of our economy of handing monetary policy over to the bank of england as a precursor, potentially, to handing it over to an independent european central bank.  there were some positive measures in the budget statement. and learned gentleman satisfy our curiosity?"
673,7/3/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Tam Dalyell,"were our suspicions in opposition wrong that, as chancellor of the exchequer, he would have dearly liked to give independence to the bank of england, but was forbidden to do so by the prime minister and others? i have always said that the views of chancellors on the independence of the bank of england are usually given after they have left office. perhaps at some stage i will give a full exposition of my views on the independence of the bank of england."
674,7/3/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke," my view on monetary policy is that it should be based, above all, on controlling inflation. if the arrangements are to be changed, the chancellor should make far better provision than he has to ensure a balanced approach. i am not the only person who thinks that giving the bank of england complete independence with the sole purpose of hitting the inflation target will mean over-insurance."
675,7/3/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke,"it certainly does not need to be combined with the fiscal tightening that has been introduced in the budget. i have watched the havoc it has caused to the lives of many able, honest and hard-working people. to help stabilise our economy and to promote sustainable growth and investment, it was my party's policy to bring greater independence to the bank of england."
676,7/3/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. John Burnett,"we are pleased that the government have adopted that policy which should assist the regions of britain especially to plan for sustainable growth and investment, free of the concerns that are generated by political interference in the day-to-day management of monetary policy. he says that he wants to encourage investment and not consumption, but that is a peculiar attempt at justification.  the chancellor's first act on taking office was to hand independence in setting monetary policy to the bank of england."
677,7/4/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Damian Green,"the purpose of that move must be to give the bank of england the power to regulate the economy when it seems to overheat. the use of monetary policy, however, is appropriate. if the chancellor believes that the bank of england should be independent, so that it can take a non-political and non-partisan approach to the regulation of the economy, it is self-evidently absurd to say, six weeks after that decision, that he will use the fiscal system."
678,7/4/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Damian Green,"so we can dismiss that argument. the likely blight to the venture capital industry caused by only the vaguest of announcements about possible changes which will not take place for nine months, but which will be backdated to budget day, is one example. in common with the announcement of the bank of england's independence, it is a sign of the government's discourtesy to this house and their arrogance."
679,7/7/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Andrew Tyrie,"incidentally, they might also explain why the document, ""public expenditure 1996 “97: provisional outturn"", was not available in the vote office after the chancellor sat down. the way to tackle overheating would be through interest rate and exchange rate policy. with bank of england independence, that is what we are going to get."
680,7/7/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Andrew Tyrie," while on the subject of exchange rates, i would like to ask the treasury front-bench team a few questions, including, for example, whether we have an exchange rate policy. friend that, every month from december   december, january, february, march and april   the governor of the bank of england advised the then chancellor that, if he did not raise interest rates, inflation would be in danger of getting out of control. we took the decision to raise interest rates and to give the bank of england operational independence."
681,7/10/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"it is now up to the conservative party to tell us whether it would raise interest rates, faced with such inflationary pressures. that is why liberal democrat members will vote against the second reading.  today is, of course, an historic day, with the bank of england raising rates independently of the government for the first time since the second world war."
682,7/10/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Davey,"the liberal democrats greatly welcome that development and it is essential that, at this early stage, ministers openly and publicly endorse the bank's decisions and the aim of low inflation. i want to say something about the broader remit of the government's economic policy, in particular today's events in the city.  we have made it clear that we fully support the government's decision to make the bank of england independent."
683,7/10/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable,"we fully support the way in which the chancellor chose to make it independent   with the government retaining the political choice of inflation objectives. in two, three or four years' time, the value of those shares will be much higher, because the company has stockpiled car bumper stickers reading ""don't blame me, i voted tory"". it may be a year or a year and a half before the effects of the budget feed through into people's pockets, but they will, and the labour party and the chancellor of the exchequer will regret having given independence to the bank of england."
684,7/10/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Fabricant," i asked the house of commons library for some information before today's interest rate rise of a further 0.25 per cent.  as has been said, the reduction will not have a dramatic impact; it is just a touch on the brake. given that we have given independence to the bank of england, if we had not introduced the reduction, home owners would in any event have had to bear the cost in the form of a marginally larger increase in interest rates."
685,7/15/1997,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"the advantage of the miras reduction is that we can reclaim some of the money and invest it either to avoid debt or to support worthwhile causes. in addition, the financial markets are concerned about moving towards european monetary union on 1 january 1999, by which time the convergence criteria will not be met by all parties, particularly italy and spain, so britain is being used as a safe haven for money. that is unfortunate for many british manufacturers, particularly those in the midlands, but the answer is not just the chancellor and the prime minister being tough, insisting on the right convergence criteria and not supporting premature entry without it; it is also about providing pricing stability, which we have established through giving the bank of england more independence, to ensure stability for manufacturers."
686,7/15/1997,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Davies," the shadow financial secretary and i were with the chairman of ford today, and he was saying that he wants stability. friend the member for pontefract and castleford has alluded to some of the measures that have been taken, such as the steps to ensure the operational independence of the bank of england.  in assessing claims of the losses that pension funds will suffer, we must give some attention to how pension funds are valued, which is on a discounted cash flow basis."
687,7/23/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Geoffrey Robinson,"it has set a high standard for its economic policies, aiming to maintain stability and foster long-term growth while seeking fairness in developing human potential. it has taken decisive steps towards these goals by making the bank of england independent, introducing a budget that makes rapid strides towards sound public finances, and initiating welfare-to-work and other programmes to enhance employability.  our policies are timely."
688,7/28/1997,Labour,labour,Jacqui Smith,"gentleman accept that it is not the toughness of the inflation target that is most important, but the toughness of the action taken to achieve it, and that in many ways my right hon. friend the chancellor has already shown his willingness to take tough action, particularly through the independence that he has given the bank of england in monetary matters? we have made it absolutely clear that it is not practical for britain to join in 1999, as the economic tests that we have set are not being met."
689,10/30/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,we are not prepared to contemplate pursuing the same stop-go boom and bust policies that bedevilled the country for the past 20 years under a conservative government and were responsible for thousands of jobs and businesses being lost unnecessarily as a result of recession. that is why we took the action that we did and made the bank of england independent and put it in operational charge of interest rates.  we still need an answer.
690,10/30/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"is the conservative party now opposing our proposals to give independence to the bank of england? is it not one thing to have an independent national central bank, namely the bank of england, but constitutionally and practically quite another for our interest rates to be controlled by an independent, unaccountable central bank in frankfurt over which the british people have no democratic control whatsoever and whose actions could decimate british jobs and do incalculable harm in this country? how can the chancellor continue to say that there are no constitutional implications to a single currency?"
691,10/30/1997,Labour,labour,Mrs. Liddell,"friend the chancellor has already made clear this afternoon, the government have taken decisive steps to strengthen economic stability. in may, we established the new framework for monetary policy, giving operational independence to the bank of england. in july, my right hon."
692,10/30/1997,Labour,labour,Mrs. Liddell,the action that my right hon. friend the chancellor took in giving operational independence to the bank of england has been widely welcomed. the only answer that we cannot get is whether the conservative party is prepared to support the bank of england bill.
693,11/7/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. John Wilkinson,"the government are taking a very relaxed, hands-off approach. the implication is that it is not their fault, because the bank of england is independent, but five interest rate rises in five months is a bit much. it is symptomatic of something fundamentally wrong."
694,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Alistair Darling)," the bill is a further step in our determination to modernise the british economy and to equip this country for the new global economy of the future. first, it gives the bank of england operational independence to set interest rates to meet the government's inflation target. it will do so through the most open, accountable set of procedures of any central bank in the world."
695,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling," the formulation, as i am sure the right hon. and learned gentleman knows, is common in most independent central banks. the objective is clear   the bank has to maintain price stability and meet the inflation target set by the chancellor of the day."
696,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"we have a uk action plan for employment and flexibility in europe, and we introduced tough legislation on competition policy. we have a new structure for financial regulation and we have given operational independence to a reformed bank of england.  that is just the start   there is more to come, including the pre-budget report later this month; capital gains tax reform; consultation on the new individual savings account; the taylor review of taxes and benefits; the low pay commission report on the minimum wage, and more."
697,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lilley,"we have always believed that the bank of england, through interest rate and funding policy, plays a key role in controlling inflation.  as long ago as 1977, in the seminal work   which i know the chancellor has committed to memory   ""the right approach to the economy"", the party said that we favoured a more independent role for the bank of england. a range of views were held then   and have been held since   about how much and what sort of independence the bank should be given."
698,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"i know that consistency is an over-rated virtue, but if the right hon. gentleman is against independence for the bank of england in principle, he ought to be reassured that the chancellor will ostensibly have so much power over the monetary committee. that fear is shared on both sides of the house, although evidently not on the government front bench."
699,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lilley," many hon. members on both sides argue that several other countries, which have a longer track record of low inflation than we do, have independent central banks, but i believe that independent banks are as much a symptom as a cause of low inflation.  the german bundesbank is independent and able to take tough action without losing its independence because germany has experienced two periods of hyper-inflation."
700,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lilley,"robert chote, the economic correspondent of the financial times, in an excellent social market foundation booklet, quotes a study that shows that countries with independent banks have suffered deeper recessions than those without them.  central banks with the same independence as the bank of england has before the bill comes into force have suffered output losses averaging about 5 per cent. of national output in each recession."
701,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lilley,"because they believe that the measures in the bill are superior. why, then, do they want to trade in the bill in a few years' time for the maastricht independent central bank? the logic of our position is that we can influence only one parliament   the next parliament   at a time."
702,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lilley,"gentleman, by treaty, wants to rule out, for all future parliaments, this country ever having its own currency, its own independent central bank, its own monetary policy. it is he who is taking a decision for all time. he cannot blame the bank, because it is no more than his adviser, so five labour interest rate rises so far are at his door."
703,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Lilley," the reason why the bank of england has used its quasi-independence to put up interest rates is because the chancellor failed to curb consumer spending by encouraging people to save their building society windfalls. instead, he taxed savings with his pensions tax.  i want to quote part of one article in the guardian last friday, in which mr."
704,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Davies,"alex brummer wrote:
 the danger of giving the bank of england operational independence always was that it would show an inflationary bias"".  i should not talk about rugby after a saturday when llanelli was trounced by the all blacks, but accusing a central bank of showing inflationary bias is like accusing the all blacks of a try-scoring bias.  if the labour party, now the government, were minded to contemplate marching towards the past by granting a greater degree of independence than the bank has enjoyed in recent years   as the hon."
705,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Clarke,"member for hackney, north and stoke newington (ms abbott) said, we have had experience in the united kingdom of independent banks   i should prefer the formulation, to which they must now cling, that was occasionally given by both the chancellor and the prime minister when they were in opposition: occasionally hinting that they might contemplate giving independence to the bank of england after it had established a good track record. as hon. it does not modernise procedures."
706,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Clarke,it is not a considered step on bank of england independence. it does not create a new anti-inflationary climate. and learned member for rushcliffe knows that very well.
707,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Radice,"the select committee looked into the matter and found that countries with independent central banks had a better inflation record than those without.  a serious counter-argument has been put by my right hon. we can reflect on the fact that, on the day that the chancellor announced his decision, long-term interest rates went down."
708,11/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"whatever the short-term considerations, the ultimate objective must be the real gains that are to be obtained from ensuring stable, low inflation, low long-term interest rates and a degree of convergence between our interest rates and those of parallel economies operating similar forms of operationally independent central banks. that ultimately is a prize with real benefits for mortgage payers, businesses and everybody who wants stability in economic management. taylor) intervened on the right hon."
709,11/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"and learned member for rushcliffe and got him middle stump by asking for his view on an independent central bank for the united kingdom as compared with a european central bank. it is neither consistent nor logical to oppose the principle of an operationally independent bank for the united kingdom while being in favour of a single currency reinforced by a central european bank.  the government have set themselves the task of preparing the country for membership of a single currency, even if, regrettably, they have effectively ruled out the possibility of an early decision in this parliament   although i suspect that they may yet have to return to that."
710,11/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"the bank is likely to have some years of operational independence before the decision is finally made to become part of the european central bank, so perhaps its track record in those years will pave the way.  the conservative party has put itself in a remarkable position, given its track record and former contacts and support: on all the central issues, it is substantially on the wrong side of the debate with the business community, which needs at least some suggestion of a practical political focus for decision making that takes account of what is really happening. members on both sides of the house have expressed some astonishment that the introduction of independent monetary control by the bank of england was announced four days after the general election without having been in the labour party's manifesto."
711,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"even the guardian of 7 may said that there was no democratic legitimacy for the proposal. there are four main reasons.  the first was explained by lord healey in his usual helpful way, when he said that the idea of an independent central bank was a gimmick to be used as an apologia by failed chancellors to shuffle off their failures on to the bank of england."
712,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"as has been pointed out, there have already been five increases in interest rates since polling day.  the second reason for the change is that every labour government have produced a sterling crisis leading to the devaluation of the pound: 1931, 1949, 1967 and 1976. by surrendering control over monetary policy, the chancellor no doubt hopes that, in the next crisis, the independence of the bank of england will provide him with an alibi."
713,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell," thirdly, the chancellor and his senior colleagues must hope that the change will provide him with a defence against his back benchers, who will not always be as supine and cringing in their parliamentary behaviour as they have been so far. when things start to go wrong on the economic front, as undoubtedly they will in the nature of things, and when unemployment starts rising, as undoubtedly it will at some point in the cycle, i hope that labour back benchers will not allow themselves to be bought off with the excuse that the measures causing unemployment are not in the control of the government but are the responsibility of the hard-hearted people on the monetary policy committee of the bank of england. the fourth, and in many ways most important, reason for the change is to prepare the way for britain to enter a single european currency managed by a european central bank that will be wholly independent of any form of democratic control."
714,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"when one tells people   even sophisticated people in the city of london and in business   that the proposed european central bank will be subject to no democratic control or influence, they express disbelief. the bill is intended as a halfway house towards our economy being managed by a european central bank. only by giving it independence at this stage can we take the necessary steps of joining the exchange rate mechanism for two years, joining the single european currency and being subsumed in the european central bank   when our gold reserves will be carried off to germany."
715,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell," all that flows from this legislation as, without the establishment as an interim measure of an independent british central bank, it will not be possible for us to join european monetary union. indeed, the maastricht treaty makes it clear that countries must establish independent central banks before they can join the european central bank. those seem good reasons for being suspicious of and, indeed, hostile to the idea of an independent central bank of england, which will take these vital decisions on monetary matters."
716,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell," the bill raises three main political considerations.  the fundamental truth about the bill, however, is that, overall, it gives the bank of england a greatly diminished institutional status. this aspect has been largely overlooked by commentators, who have concentrated on the bank's enhanced independence in the setting of interest rates, but everyone in the bank of england understands all too well the loss of power and prestige that will flow from the government announcement of 6 may, which is why the governor of the bank of england very nearly resigned on that day, as he has said."
717,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell," ever since it was founded in the reign of king william iii, the bank of england has exercised authority over a wider range of matters than any other central bank.  my conclusion is that the bill should be opposed, not only on the practical grounds that it will make the efficient macro-economic management of our affairs more difficult, lead to higher levels of unemployment than are necessary and diminish the power, influence and prestige of the bank of england, but above all because it is a further constitutional retreat along the road to a single european currency and the sacrifice of british parliamentary self-government to the bureaucracies of a federal europe. there is no more powerful thing in the realm of economic ideas than fashion, and it is with some timidity that i stand up against the prevailing tide of fashion, which says that the answer for the british economy is an independent central bank; none the less, faced with the facts, i must do so."
718,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott," it was remarkable to see a labour government, elected in triumph with the biggest majority since the war, within days   not even weeks, but days   hand over one of the most important levers of economic power to an unelected quango. it is relatively easy to bring down inflation by simply slowing down activity; the trick is to achieve growth and low inflation. the argument that i have consistently advanced in my eight years on the treasury select committee, and which i advance tonight in the chamber, is that an independent central bank is not the best way to combine low inflation with growth."
719,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott, i really cannot accept the attempts of ministers to wrap this policy decision up in the mantra of modernity.  i remind hon. members that an independent central bank is not a new idea: britain had experience of an independent central bank until 1945.
720,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"i shall quote from the 1945 labour manifesto   i know that it will embarrass some of my hon. bruce) said that, if the government leave monetary policy to the independent central bank, they can concentrate on things that really shape the long-term economy. what a fatuous thing to say."
721,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Diane Abbott,"what shapes the long-term economy more than the level of interest rates?  when europhile members talk about other european countries and their independent central banks, they do not mention that the role of interest rates in the british economy is rather different, and slightly more sensitive, than that in other economies. for example, in germany, a far smaller proportion of people own their own homes."
722,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott," it is not just a matter of the british body politic being more sensitive to interest rates. all adherents to the idea of an independent central bank ignore the fact that interest rates are not a technical matter: they should not be decided in eddie george's boardroom once a month. interest rates affect not just house prices, but the level of bankruptcy among businesses and the level of unemployment."
723,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"members are passionate about this subject, but i must continue.  much has been said about how the treasury select committee will hold the new independent central bank to account. i bow to no one in my respect for the treasury select committee, under the distinguished chairmanship of my colleague the member for north durham (mr."
724,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott," it is worth making another point that has not been made all evening. although there is a relationship between independent central banks and low inflation   there is no question about that   a definite causal link between an independent central bank and low inflation has never been established. in other words, contrary to what my hon."
725,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"friends and some liberal democrats may say, merely having an independent central bank by no means guarantees low inflation. i would argue that a country such as germany, which has an independent central bank, has that independent central bank because it has a low-inflation culture.  let us stop and ask ourselves why the germans feel strongly about low inflation and are willing to make sacrifices to keep it low."
726,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"that country has an almost primal fear of hyper-inflation. i believe that it is not the independence of the bundesbank that has caused germany's excellent low-inflation record, but germany's history and the state of its economy that has created a low-inflation climate, of which an independent central bank is a symptom and not a cause.  the bill will hand over one of the most important levers of economic policy to eddie george."
727,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"friends in the treasury are victims of economic fashion. there is considerable academic evidence that the downside of an independent central bank is, as was said earlier, that it is hard to achieve co-ordination of policy, and there are risks to jobs and growth, and the danger of an overvalued pound.  i remind the house that, of the 20 most frequently cited studies on central bank independence, only one associates independent central banks with growth."
728,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"in a study by guy debelle and stanley fischer, they stated:
 since 1962, countries with independent central banks have suffered deeper recessions on average than those without.  mark hutchison and carl walsh found the same thing in a study of new zealand, and robert chote, the financial editor of the financial times, writing in a personal capacity, said: 
 people may lose their jobs unnecessarily because mr. like the hon."
729,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Michael Spicer,"lady, i have long held reservations about the concept of an independent central bank. let us not beat about the bush or kid ourselves: once the bill is enacted, the chancellor of the exchequer will have a legitimate right to deflect the questions of hon. i am grateful for the opportunity to take part in such an important debate."
730,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Ms Ruth Kelly,"the move to grant operational independence to the bank of england is certainly the most radical shake-up that has been seen in the operation of monetary policy since sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism, and possibly the most radical shake-up since the war.  i shall not engage in the argument as to whether low inflation or price stability is a good idea. some of those allegations were very strong, and i am sure that when he reads them in hansard he will be very disappointed that he was not here to answer them."
731,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Andrew Tyrie," i am sympathetic in principle to the idea of central bank independence, but i cannot support these half-baked proposals. i shall explain why in just a moment. permissible."
732,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Andrew Tyrie,"those breaches of pledge do not register with the electors at the moment, but they will in time   as will the arrogance of the chancellor, for example, when he reluctantly came to the house to announce bank of england independence.  i want to make three points. first, i want to explain why bank of england independence has become such an issue only over the past 15 years."
733,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Andrew Tyrie,"secondly, i want to explain why the proposals in the bill are a bit of a dog's dinner and why they probably will not deliver independence   i would be much more sympathetic to them if i thought they would. for most of that time the monetary anchor was the gold standard, or bretton woods in the post-war period. national monetary policy was subordinate to the external anchor, so central bank independence did not matter very much."
734,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Andrew Tyrie," it was only after bretton woods collapsed that the debate about central bank independence gathered pace, both here and abroad   a period during which many countries decided to create independent central banks, and a time during which successive britain governments had directors at the international monetary fund who were busy encouraging all countries to adopt independent central banks.  after the collapse of bretton woods, our politicians soon had british monetary policy in a mess, which began to be sorted out only when the imf arrived in 1976. of course, part of the premium we were paying reflected policy mistakes, but the policy makers are just as likely to make misjudgments whether they sit in threadneedle street or in whitehall."
735,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Andrew Tyrie," the main purpose of central bank independence is not to call upon superior minds to do the job   i do not think that they are better ones in threadneedle street   but to close the credibility gap and deal with the belief that politicians might be meddling in monetary policy with political objectives in mind.  the crucial question is whether the bill's proposals close the credibility gap. clearly, the bill will enable people who put their faith in british banks, and who therefore deposit their money in british banks, to know that there is an independent regulatory and supervisory authority."
736,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Vaz," my point is that the collusion between the previous government and the governor of the bank of england, which was not independent, enabled meetings to take place about bcci, and stopped an independent view being taken of the problems with bcci. had there not been that collusion, and had there been independent and proper regulation. the fact that i was not here when he last spoke about bcci does not mean that i am not aware of what he said."
737,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Loughton,"how does he think that the fsa will be more independent of the chancellor than the bank of england was? the fsa is a new organisation which will be concentrating on supervising banks, and it will have the regulatory power to do so. with the greatest respect, i have to say that the involvement of the then deputy governor of the bank of england, now the governor, and all his officials at the bank meant that there was not the necessary independence."
738,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Vaz,"the bank did not have the necessary credibility to supervise bcci properly. however, it covers some important matters which need to be debated now, before the bill goes into committee. in general, my party supports the bill, as we favour operational independence for the bank of england and the idea of statutory uniform regulation."
739,11/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable,"within that broad framework, however, many questions still need to be answered. she tried to link the conduct of monetary policy with long-term investment and growth decisions.  the simple fact is that the bank of england, whether or not it is independent, has responsibility solely for short-term interest rates."
740,11/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable,"long-term interest rates, which are what really matter for the cost of capital in business and which influence long-term investment decisions, are set not by the bank of england or the government but in the markets.  long-term interest rates are set in international markets but can be affected by expectations of inflation. it is the ability of an independent central bank to maintain low and stable inflation which gives low long-term interest rates."
741,11/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable,"that is what matters for investment and growth, and that is why the bill is so important.  on the issue of central bank independence, i have a query about the link between this debate and our eventual entry into economic and monetary union. as the government know, we support their broad approach to emu, but we are critical of the fact that they have passed up the opportunity for early entry."
742,11/11/1997,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable,"that will present some tricky transitional problems for an independent bank of england.  those problems were graphically outlined in the interviews given by mr. clarke), the previous chancellor of the exchequer."
743,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Austin Mitchell,"i regret the fact that, while the first act of the labour government in 1945 was to nationalise the bank of england, the first act of the labour government in 1997 was to give the bank of england independent control over the most important lever of economic management.  i have no quarrel with the regulatory parts of the bill, because the bank of england had too many roles   none of which it performed well   to be an effective regulator. neither case suggests that price stability and low inflation are of any great benefit to the economy."
744,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Austin Mitchell," there is no evidence on whether an independent central bank is better at dealing with inflation. that is a fad, not a fact. the best authority on the issue is a book by eijffinger and de haan."
745,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Austin Mitchell,"their conclusions, which appear to be common sense, are that
 a country with an independent central bank will. ceteris paribus,""   
 which they never are   
 have a lower rate of inflation than will a country where politicians can steer the central bank's policy. investors are attracted to britain by higher interest rates, but repelled by the uncertainties in europe."
746,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Austin Mitchell," giving the bank of england   which has no higher wisdom in facing any problem than to put up interest rates   independent power over interest rates inevitably increases the value of the pound, and that has a damaging effect on the economy. indeed, it will lead to a balance of payments problem, a fall in exports, an increase in imports and a loss of jobs. all that will happen next year, just when the new deal will be coming in to fight inflation and unemployment by micro-policies that will run contrary to the macro-policy enforced by the independent bank of england."
747,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Austin Mitchell," if britain is managed by interest rates   which is what the bank of england is attempting to do   it will be inherently more unstable than most of its competitors, because interest rates are crucial in our economy and most people are on flexible rather than fixed-rate mortgages. however, they do not represent the interests of manufacturers, which remain the drive motor of our economy and generate jobs.  a misguided decision based on myths and inaccurate information, carried out at the wrong time   just when it can do maximum damage to the economy   made the bank of england independent on interest rate policy."
748,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Austin Mitchell,"that brings me to my basic argument against the entire bill: it destroys democratic accountability.  i shall keep my remarks brief, as i am keen to hear the debate among labour members on a matter that obviously divides them deeply.  the chancellor's decision to give the bank of england independence over interest rates will prove to be the government's first major policy error, and it occurred within four days of the new labour government coming to office."
749,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nick Gibb,"it has resulted in the abandonment of a monetary and economic policy that has yielded the best inflationary record for 50 years, low and falling unemployment, and steady growth. it has removed from direct control and accountability a principal lever of economic policy. as robert chote   who has been quoted many times tonight   the economics editor of the financial times, wrote in his excellent paper for the social market foundation, an independent bank of england
 will weaken democratic control over a vital area of public policy."
750,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nick Gibb," monetary policy, and the conduct of monetary policy, has such a fundamental effect on people's lives and is so fundamental a part of economic policy that it has to be in the hands of those elected to office. it will result in higher than necessary interest rates, with all the consequences for mortgages, for the competitiveness of british business and for higher unemployment.  by giving the bank of england independence on interest rates, the government are signing up to the latest fashionable, quick-fix panacea."
751,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nick Gibb,"all the panaceas that governments have adopted over many decades   the gold standard in the 1920s and 1930s, the parity with the dollar in the 1940s, the bretton woods arrangement and, most recently, the exchange rate mechanism   have ended in failure. the previous conservative government opted for, and delivered, long-term stability.  the various studies that have been trumpeted by the very few supporters of the bill who have spoken today show that countries with an independent central bank have lower average inflation rates than countries that do not."
752,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb,"i acknowledge that. the harvard institute of economic research showed, for example, that countries with central banks with the most independence   switzerland, germany and the usa   had an average inflation rate of less than 4 per cent. between 1951 and 1988."
753,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb,"those countries with central banks with the least independence   spain, australia and the united kingdom   had average inflation rates of 7 per cent. during that time.  however, as the hon."
754,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb,"member for hackney, north and stoke newington (ms abbott) said, when she opposed the government's policy in an adjournment debate:
 although there may be a statistical relationship between central bank independence and low inflation, no causal relationship can be established.""    [official report, 11 june 1997; vol. 295, c. 1055.]
 she repeated that comment today."
755,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb,"that view is backed up by michael jenkins of hull university, who has commented that there is no statistically significant relationship between high central bank independence and low inflation.  i come to the cost of the policy. it is not the lack of a causal link that prompts my opposition to the bill."
756,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb,"those countries with independent central banks have experienced much deeper recessions than those without, as the hon. member for great grimsby (mr. he quoted the academics sylvester eijffinger and jakob de haan, who have studied the point in great detail."
757,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb,"they cite five studies of central banks, four of which show that, for any given reduction in inflationary pressure, the deflationary cost is higher in those countries with independent central banks than in those without.  another academic study in 1994 by guy debelle and stanley fischer showed that since 1962 those countries with independent central banks have suffered deeper recessions, on average, than those without. the countries with independent central banks did not enjoy higher growth levels, despite the high social costs of the recessions, so there was no compensatory rise in growth in the long term."
758,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb," the reason for that phenomenon is plain.  since the election, evidence of over-deflationary bias has been still more manifest. in six months, we have seen five interest rate rises   empirical evidence that independent central banks are more prone to set higher and excessive rates of interest than those that are not independent, because the incentives exist for them to do so."
759,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb,"the government acknowledged that fact soon after their announcement, on 6 may, of their decision to give the bank independence. gentleman asserted that the five rises in interest rates since the election were caused by independence being given to the bank of england. he has no counter-factual evidence to suggest that interest rates would not have been higher under political control."
760,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb," in 1978, the humphrey-hawkings act specifically set the federal reserve the dual target of full employment and price stability.  we are talking about something more fundamental than merely the structure of the objectives of an independent central bank, however. the principal reason for the success of the federal reserve in recent years is that the fed is chaired by alan greenspan, a man who consistently gets it right."
761,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb,"that is very much a political view.  whether an independent central bank will be successful depends on the composition of the monetary policy committee and on the governor. that is fine if things go well, but what happens if they go wrong?"
762,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb,"to create that, one needs the backing of the british people. we can have any number in of independent institutions which are crafted and structured in any way we wish, but if the support of the people is not there, the central bank will not succeed. as robert chote says:
 central banks will only succeed in delivering low inflation if they reflect fundamental support for price stability in society."
763,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb,"even new labour does not trust new labour.  there was not a single word in the labour party manifesto about giving independence to the bank of england. it merely said:
 we will reform the bank of england to ensure that decision making on monetary policy is more effective, open, accountable and free from short-term political manipulation."
764,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb," despite what the economic secretary said earlier, that does not mean giving the bank of england independence. there is not a hint in that phrase about a plan which, in the words of the prime minister, is the
 biggest step in economic policy making in britain since world war two. but every major economic decision taken by the government since the election is designed, whether deliberately or not, to increase unemployment."
765,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb," the decision to give the bank of england independence is leading to excessive rises in interest rates, which will, in due course, lead to unemployment increasing. the budget and the finance act will take Â£10 billion out of the economy. the government have signed up to the social chapter and proposed the introduction of a minimum wage, all of which will lead to job losses."
766,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb," on 20 may, the chancellor stated that the introduction of an independent bank of england and the appointment of a monetary policy committee would be scrutinised by the treasury committee. i searched in vain through the bill for even one reference to the treasury committee. what is the government's policy on exchange rate?"
767,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb," the late lord ridley, in his autobiography, opposed an independent bank of england, writing:
 for what purpose would they use interest rate policy? in order to try to secure an artificial exchange rate, or to control the domestic money supply?  what is the government's strategy, and can the bank of england be so trusted?"
768,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb," the government's rhetoric is of openness, but they announced the independence of the bank of england on 6 may, the day before parliament assembled. was that so urgent that it had to be dealt with on a monday rather than a tuesday? the government trumpeted their introduction of a green budget and draft legislation for consultation, but took the biggest step in economic decision making since the war with no consultation or debate, before any announcement to the house."
769,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb," the chancellor may be a close ally of the prime minister's, but in his six months in office he has made a series of political decisions that will do our economy enormous damage: the decision to give the bank of england independence; the Â£5 billion smash-and-grab raid on britain's pension funds; and the decision to take britain into the single currency after the next general election. those are the government's three most damaging decisions since the general election; they were all made by the chancellor and will all, i believe, lead the labour party to lose office at the next general election. i urge the house to vote against the first of them this evening."
770,11/11/1997,Independent Conservative,conservative,Mr. Howard Flight,"this hotch-potch privatisation   the independence of the bank of england   will, like the chancellor's budget, soon lose its initial popularity. if we are to have an independent central bank, let us do it properly like the federal reserve and have proper, full and open accountability and let those who are responsible be properly serviced and have objectives that cover the full range of economic activity, not merely over-narrow, anti-inflation objectives.  the government are claiming that there is some democratic accountability in the bill and that they are opting for a midway house   the best that britain can do at this stage."
771,11/11/1997,Independent Conservative,conservative,Mr. Howard Flight,"in that case, i cannot understand why the chancellor is so keen on the proposed arrangements for the european central bank. that will be the worst sort of independent central bank arrangement   a bank that is not in any way democratically accountable and that leaves the door wide open for all the dangers that the hon. member for hackney, north and stoke newington (ms abbott) described so well."
772,11/11/1997,Independent Conservative,conservative,Mr. Howard Flight,"tyrie), i am opposed to the bill. it does not do the proper professional job required if we are to go down the route of having an independent central bank. if we want to do that, let us do it professionally, like the federal reserve."
773,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory,"although they are bound to be dismissed as the voice of old labour by the trendies on the treasury bench, they nevertheless represent a more authentic labour tradition, from which we shall hear much more before this parliament is out.  more generally, the debate has shown that the government proposals for a central bank that is independent in this country are not proposals for an independent bank in a real sense. they would be better described as proposals for a quango bank, designed to take unpopular decisions about things such as interest rates, but leaving the powers of appointment, the power to override and many other important powers, in the hands of the chancellor of the exchequer and the government."
774,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory," as a result, the bill will not satisfy those who believe in a genuinely independent central bank. they must be pretty numerous on the labour benches, because they are now committed in principle to the most independent central bank in the world, to be set up in frankfurt   the european central bank. that bank, as we heard in the debate, will be forbidden to take any instructions from national governments or parliaments, and will not be accountable to any democratic body or institution, anywhere, for the foreseeable future."
775,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory,"that is entrenched in treaty law   which is, of course, superior to national law.  the government, and labour members who want the united kingdom to join a single european currency, have not followed through on that in the bill, or even taken the halfway step of setting up such a genuinely independent bank for our own purposes, so the bill will not satisfy those who believe in a genuinely independent central bank. nor will it satisfy those hon."
776,11/11/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Heathcoat-Amory,and learned friend the member for rushcliffe (mr. clarke) explained to the house that the achievement of low inflation does not require an independent central bank. the conservative government established an inflation target of 2.5 per cent.
777,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mrs. Liddell,"he says one thing, but then says another.  presumably the single currency is of a much lower order than independence from the bank of england. on the one hand the right hon."
778,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mrs. Liddell,"gentleman says that giving the bank of england operational independence is wrong; then he says that we are not giving it enough independence, because the monetary policy committee could be influenced by the chancellor. i hope that, by the time the bill is considered in standing committee, opposition members will have made up their minds whether they are coming or going.  several hon."
779,11/11/1997,Labour,labour,Mrs. Liddell,"members mentioned british independence for the central bank, and the emu-compatible bank. as i said, it is interesting to see how hon. it is a matter of regret that prime minister's questions take place only once a week."
780,11/13/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mrs. Shephard,"it is a matter of regret that the announcement of the operational independence of the bank of england was made not by a statement to the house but by a press conference. it is a matter of regret that we had an announcement of the government's policy on the european single currency, again not by a statement but by telephone calls by the chancellor's press secretary. this winter, the federal german republic will have unemployment of probably 5 million and spain's unemployment rate is at 20 per cent."
781,11/24/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. John Wilkinson,"in this country, is it not true that an independent central bank has masterminded four out of the five interest rate increases that have taken place under this administration? after hearing the shadow chancellor, the country will understand how fortunate it was to get rid of the conservative government in may. even now, why does he not apologise for the previous government putting vat on fuel?"
782,11/25/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown," as for economic policy, the shadow chancellor suggested that he agreed with what i have been doing, but he opposed our monetary policy reforms and even now he cannot tell us whether he would make the bank of england independent or stop it being independent. he opposed our five-year deficit reduction plan, and even now he cannot tell us whether he thinks that our figures are too high, right or too low. it was for those reasons that we took immediate action."
783,11/25/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"we raised interest rates immediately, and made the bank of england independent. there have had to be further rises in interest rates. i understand that this morning he launched an exhibition on the kent thames-side region, and i wish him well in his efforts both to form an effective public-private partnership there and to attract inward investment."
784,11/27/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"what is absolutely clear is that for inward investment we need a stable monetary framework   that is why we gave the bank of england independence   a commitment to europe, sustainable public finances and measures such as our cuts in corporation tax for long-term investment, which are all measures that we support. we have still to hear what the opposition think of them. friend is absolutely correct."
785,11/27/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Robinson,"it is precisely because the conservative party did not have the political courage to give operational independence to the bank of england that economic policy was too often dictated by political expediency. that is why we experienced the two biggest recessions and the two biggest periods of inflation during 10 years of hopelessly incompetent macro-economic policy under the conservative party. i am surprised that a number of the new labour independent central bank freaks are not jumping up and asking, ""are you not in favour of independent central banks, and is not the bundesbank a frightfully successful institution?""
 the answer is that there is no such thing as a truly independent central bank."
786,11/27/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Jenkin,"even though the bundesbank, for example, has a large measure of independence in the setting of interest rates and the governance of monetary policy, it is an institution that enjoys the wholehearted consent of the people of germany.  while the german people may accept that decision as inevitable at this stage of the proceedings, and while many other countries may even vote for it in referendums   it must be acknowledged that the issue may be decided in that way by this country   the problem is not the consent to that proposition, but the on-going consent on an annual basis to the way in which economic policy is determined. i am not sure how that naturally arose from the discussion of cyprus, but of course the principle established in the maastricht treaty is that the central bank will be independent and will not be subject to political interference."
787,12/4/1997,Labour,labour,Mr. Cook,"in that regard, it will stand in relation to the governments of the european union in precisely the same way that the independent central banks of germany and of other countries stand in relation to their governments.  enlargement is the prime objective that we seek to achieve at the luxembourg summit. heath) did, for it to be accountable."
788,12/4/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Wells,"monetary union, with a central bank, is designed to be independent of politicians. the central bank will be very much more independent than the bundesbank because there will be no powerful parliament to which it has to be accountable or responsible. the bundesbank can be influenced by the federal parliament in bonn and it was demonstrably overridden on the value of the western and eastern mark."
789,12/8/1997,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Letwin,"if that is his intention, surely it behoves him to tell the house now.  one way or another, we are bound to conclude that the bill bears a striking similarity to the bank of england bill, in that it appears to give another body a basis for independence   but, having given that appearance, it takes it back in clause 80. it creates a poodle, and, moreover, a poodle that can be kicked."
790,1/22/1998,Labour,labour,Ms Ruth Kelly,"gentleman think that the credibility of government policy fell on the announcement of independence for the bank of england? from the facts, it is absolutely clear that the markets thought that the credibility of government policy had been enhanced because long bond yields fell.  the chief secretary's second argument was that, in a hung parliament, a party political ball game would be played in the select committee, which would make it difficult for the government to govern and make those key appointments."
791,1/22/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Charles Clarke,"i take that point, but, if we are concerned with the independence of the central bank from those party political ball games and the uncertainties surrounding a hung parliament, it would be better and more effective to use the open hearing process; in addition, there would be no risk of the prime minister or chancellor appointing cronies with no chance for public scrutiny. therefore, the second argument does not stand up.  there is a second, more pragmatic and, indeed, monetary reason why it would be sensible for the government to accept new clause 1   but the government do not often do very sensible things, so i do not expect that they will do this now."
792,1/22/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies," the new clause will make it easier for the government to achieve what they say was their prime purpose in making the bank of england operationally independent. the main purpose of doing so was to give the markets confidence that monetary policy is being conducted in accordance with monetary criteria, to achieve the monetary purpose of price stability   the permanent removal of inflation in our national affairs   and is not subject to political, personal or electoral pressures according to the day-to-day convenience and self-interest of ministers.  the world is changing."
793,1/22/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies,"as a result of one of the salient changes, almost every civilised country now has an independent central bank. it would be an enormous liability for our country if, of the major currencies of the world, only sterling was managed in such a way that it was seen to be subject to extraneous party political or electoral pressures. i believe that that is the price of the government having been extremely indecisive about, for example, what we are doing about monetary union."
794,1/22/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies," it is very important that the independence of the bank of england should, as far as possible, achieve some certainty that monetary policy is not subject to party political and electoral pressures. as the hon. member for bolton, west (ms kelly) said, the announcement of the operational independence of the bank of england has had some positive effect in terms of the premia we pay in the money markets and in the government bond markets at present."
795,1/22/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies,"we still have a long way to go, and it is important that operational independence is regarded as credible, domestically and internationally.  an announcement by the labour government that the bank of england has been given operational independence, that monetary policy is henceforth in the hands of the monetary policy committee and that that committee will be answerable for monetary policy not to the chancellor but to parliament through the treasury committee sounds wonderful. it appears that that arrangement will go quite a long way towards achieving the declared purposes of the move."
796,1/22/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Quentin Davies,"therefore, members will be up for reappointment within the term of this government and, if they want to stay on the committee, they had better be nice to the man who appoints them. it does not take a great deal of human intelligence to lead one to discount to a considerable degree the independence of a central bank whose monetary policy committee is appointed on that basis.  in order to achieve independence, to reap the benefits of monetary credibility, achieve a positive impact on inflation expectations in this country   that is vital in terms of savings behaviour, wage negotiation, general price determination behaviour and so on   and to ensure that the cost of capital in this country is no higher than we need and that we do not have to pay excessive risk premia in the markets, we should welcome any measure that is designed to strengthen the credibility of that independence."
797,1/22/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Giles Radice,"i have just returned from the funeral of a close family friend.  the chancellor wrote to me, as chairman of the treasury committee, after announcing the operational independence of the bank of england in the area of monetary policy. in that letter, he suggested an enhanced role for the committee in examining the performance of the bank, and wrote:
 i see this as an important step in ensuring that the bank is fully accountable."
798,1/22/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Cable,"it is crucial that the legislation works. the independence of the bank of england is a good concept, and we agree with it in principle. however, this measure is not guaranteed to work, and whether it does will depend on its design; its design depends critically on credibility."
799,1/22/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Cable,"gentleman's proposal is one way in which to do that.  the liberal democrats strongly support the basic principle of independence of the bank of england. we support the concept that the government have introduced, although we regret that they have not been more flexible over some of the amendments designed to improve the bill."
800,1/22/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Heathcoat-Amory,"or less   by the date of the general election.  however, we know that setting up an independent bank of england is not necessarily   and certainly not sufficiently   the way to achieve low inflation, because plenty of independent central banks in the world have fairly poor inflation records. historians will know that the weimar republic had an independent central bank called the reichsbank, which was not very successful."
801,1/22/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Heathcoat-Amory,"similarly, as the previous government's record shows, it is possible to establish low inflation and to achieve a low inflation target without an independent central bank, by using the full array of weapons at the disposal of any chancellor   monetary weapons, taxation and expenditure. we do not agree that giving independence to a central bank is the only way to achieve low inflation.  moreover, there are dangers in making a mechanical change without having established a low-inflation credential and record."
802,1/22/1998,Conservative,conservative,Michael Spicer,"gentleman on amendment no. 26, which replaces ""employment"" with
 the level of the exchange rate"",
 if that arises from his worry about false exchange rates, which may occur if an independent central bank pushes us towards a single currency.  we have only to look across the channel to see what has happened in france."
803,1/22/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb,"1. clauses 11 and 12 are key to the monetary objectives of the bank of england, once it achieves independence. clause 11 states:
 in relation to monetary policy, the objectives of the bank of england shall be   
 (a) to maintain price stability""."
804,1/22/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Gibb,"all inflationary problems would be dealt with by the bank of england and, again, there would be a recipe for higher interest rates than would otherwise be necessary.  in conclusion, the amendment seeks to enable that conflict to be sorted out, and to enable the treasury to write to the bank of england to put on the record how this inherent conflict, which arises from giving the bank of england independence, should be resolved by those responsible for britain's economic policy. this is the best opportunity to say something on the substantive economics of the issue rather than on the constitutional issues that we dealt with before."
805,1/22/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Cable,"we had a period of lax control of money, a very high rate of inflation and then, over-compensation through high interest rates. the whole purpose of the legislation and of an independent central bank is to prevent such a problem from arising again.  sterling is also very high because of the emu premium."
806,1/22/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Cable,"it is a genuine technical issue; it is also a political issue. it is perfectly possible for governments   or, in this case, an independent central bank   to run a tight monetary policy and for it to be undermined by profligate fiscal policy. that is why the liberal democrats argue very strongly that this measure should be followed by another, which we would call the fiscal responsibility act, which would make a set of rules for fiscal policy to match those in the bill."
807,1/22/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Mitchell,"booms and busts   wild fluctuations   are therefore built into our economy and are almost inevitable.  the first result of the attempt to provide greater stability, by giving independent power to the bank of england, has been to increase instability. in real terms, interest rates are now at almost record levels and are certainly higher than in the 1960s and 1970s."
808,1/22/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling," this is an historic bill. for many years there has been much talk and discussion about the merits of an independent central bank; indeed, there have been many debates in the house. on entering office we made it clear that we believed that the best way to obtain price stability and a commitment to low inflation was to give the bank of england operational independence to meet the government's inflation target of 2Â½ per cent."
809,1/22/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"the bill is a cornerstone of the government's economic strategy.  this country depends on its international trade and on markets having confidence in the government's ability to deliver economic stability and low inflation. the independence of the central bank, the code of fiscal stability and the pre-budget report are all planks in the same strategy to ensure that there is openness."
810,1/22/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"openness brings confidence and certainty that the government will not be moved from their determination to deliver low inflation. nine months after the announcement by my right hon. friend the chancellor of the exchequer that we would give the bank of england operational independence, we still do not know where the conservatives stand on this question."
811,1/22/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"it is less than 15 minutes before we shall vote and they have not told us whether they are for or against the measure. uniquely among the major parties, we campaigned for the reform of the bank of england and we welcome the labour party's conversion to that policy now that it is in government.  the chief secretary to the treasury explained the benefits of an independent central bank."
812,1/22/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"it is important to have those benefits on record because we have heard so many arguments against an independent central bank. as the bank of england builds its reputation as an institution that is ready to fight inflation, it is important that public and political support is strengthened and that people recognise the strong arguments for its independence.  i reiterate the comments of the chief secretary to the treasury about the need for the conservatives to put their view of this policy on record."
813,1/22/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"they should acknowledge their mistakes in government and their failure to produce a strong, anti-inflation policy through an independent central bank. they have still not changed their policy, but it is important that they do so, because for the bank to be effective in the long term, there must be cross-party consensus on its independence.  in its current form, the bill will not appeal to those of my hon."
814,1/22/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Heathcoat-Amory,"friends who in principle support the concept of an independent central bank. the bank provided for in the bill will not be independent like, for instance, the bundesbank or the federal reserve in the united states, and it does not qualify as an independent central bank under the treaty of rome as amended at maastricht. further legislation will therefore be needed if and when we proceed to full economic and monetary union."
815,2/5/1998,Labour,labour,Mrs. Beckett,gentleman being so critical of the monetary policy committee and of the bank of england. my impression was that many conservative members supported moves towards the type of independence for the bank of england on interest rates that my right hon. friend has introduced.
816,3/9/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Boswell," there is an essential ambiguity in the government's attitude. the bank of england bill implements one of their treasured policies, about which i have grave reservations: to introduce a monetary policy committee, independent of the chancellor, to run our monetary policy. in that bill, they provided for a way out in cases of external economic shocks."
817,3/10/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"we have met that challenge.  immediately upon taking office, we granted independence to the bank of england. we do not know what conservative members think about that, but the impact was to reduce overnight long-term borrowing costs by 0.29 per cent."
818,3/10/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Denham,"boom and bust economics, short-term fixes that throw people out of work and prevent them from saving, and uncertainty, which stops companies investing, all existed under the previous government, and undermine the economy, investment, british companies and the ability to create the wealth on which our pension incomes depend.  last july's budget, which took place after the chancellor gave the bank of england greater power and independence, was intended to create conditions for steady, sustainable economic growth. we set out to put the economy on a solid foundation by scrapping measures that distorted investment decisions, by cutting corporation tax and, above all, by putting the country's finances on a sound footing."
819,3/11/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"we inherited a structural budget deficit and the return of inflation to the system. by giving the bank of england independence in the setting of interest rates and by tackling the structural deficit, we have the chance for the first time in generations to end tory boom and bust and to have prudent, stable management of the economy. even allowing for the fact that the speech that a leader of the main opposition party has to give straight after the budget statement is probably the most difficult that has to be made in the house, in my time, i have not heard a more intemperate or more inaccurate speech than the one that has just been made by the leader of the conservative party."
820,3/17/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Paddy Ashdown,"the chancellor has allocated some extra money for the education and nhs budgets, about which   he will not be surprised to hear   more later.  we applaud the chancellor for adopting what has been our policy for years on a fiscal responsibility code and the independent status of the bank of england   something that was in our manifesto, but not his, yet he adopted it three days after the election. we think it right that the government have adopted a budget judgment that is broadly neutral and pretty cautious."
821,3/17/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Paddy Ashdown,"once again, we are faced with the possibility   i place it no higher than that   of another spin around that old back-breaking british cycle of boom and bust, which has dogged us for so long. that is a depressing outcome for a chancellor whom i believe to be sincere about wanting to manage for the long term, and whose first act was, commendably, to give independence to the bank of england   something that we proposed, but he did.  the second consequence of labour's foolish pre-election promises on taxation and spending is that the government cannot now fund an early start to delivering their self-declared early pledges on health and education."
822,3/17/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. James Plaskitt,"doesmy hon. friend not she accept that since the government granted independence to the bank of england, long-term interest rates have consistently fallen and are at their lowest for more than 30 years, and that that is the pointer for the future movement of interest rates, rather than what has happened over the past few months? friend must accept that a socialist government should run the economy not for the benefit of the bond market and bond speculators, but with a view to the prospects for growth and jobs in the real economy."
823,3/17/1998,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott," the argument that an independent bank of england by itself produces stability and low inflation is an argument of reverse causality. germany has an independent central bank, and low interest rates and stability, and people say that we would have the same happy conditions if we had such a bank. i argued at length in the treasury select committee that the germans are prepared to have an independent central bank and such a monetary policy for specific historical reasons."
824,3/17/1998,Labour,labour,Ms Abbott,"there is no statistical evidence of a causal relationship between an independent central bank and low inflation.  the chancellor still boasts about handing over control of interest rates to the bank of england, but he will not boast for much longer. members have spoken about the fact that the bank of england is now independent, but the chancellor is not ignorant of the policy that the bank has to operate or of the climate in which it operates."
825,3/17/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Robert Smith,"he can still affect the climate that affects interest rates and he has to be aware of how his actions will affect it. that is a key device for linking the performance of the united kingdom economy with that of our european partners, and i know that it will be appreciated by hundreds of companies in my constituency that are heavily dependent on trade with the rest of the european union.  if we relate the code for fiscal stability to the new bank of england independence, the government's deficit reduction plan, the strategy for debt management and the clear map that has been laid out for progress towards european monetary union, we can see that the government have created a substantially more stable climate for the economy."
826,3/17/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Plaskitt,"it stands in sharp and quite dramatic contrast to the record of the previous administration. it may come to be seen as little more than a charter for fiscal irresponsibility.  of course, it was trumpeted as the counterpart to bolstering the credibility of monetary policy with bank of england independence."
827,3/17/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"i am not even sure whether we have an independent bank yet. we welcome measures to tackle unemployment, not least through the boosting of skills   and changes in national insurance contributions. we welcome the introduction of a fiscal responsibility code, which   rather like the independent bank of england   was first proposed by the liberal democrats."
828,3/18/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Don Foster,"we welcome measures to provide attendance allowances for women. their mismanagement meant that there were hidden taxes   for example, the bse crisis cost Â£3.7 billion, and the underpricing of shares in the privatisation programme cost Â£5.7 billion. moreover, it took the labour government to give the bank of england independence, which is saving Â£6 billion a year in terms of the repayment of government debt, as long-term borrowing costs are the lowest for 30 years."
829,3/18/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Davies," another myth is that the conservatives are the friends of rural areas   we have just heard that claptrap from the hon. someone has gone to tremendous trouble to produce these figures, which, sadly, may all be absolute rubbish because of two desperate blunders made by the government soon after they came to office. handing over independence of the bank of england to a small group of advisers has deprived the chancellor of one of the vital tools in controlling the speed of the economy."
830,3/18/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Owen Paterson,"every week the prime minister gets in the phrase ""boom and bust"".  the government's commitment to sustainable and sound public finances can be seen in numerous measures undertaken since last may. the tough five-year deficit reduction plan is based on the need to encourage long-term investment, and the granting of operational independence to the bank of england, which will provide a clear and accountable monetary framework, has already reduced long-term borrowing costs by one third of 1 per cent., which will save taxpayers around Â£6 billion a year."
831,3/19/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Jim Cunningham," since the may election, the government have twice had the opportunity to reduce corporation tax and, on both occasions, they have seized it. it is the most damaging thing to the economy of the nation. that is why, on the very day we took office, the bank of england was granted operational independence."
832,3/19/1998,Labour,labour,The Paymaster General(Mr. Geoffrey Robinson),"that is why we set in hand a series of changes that, so far from being piecemeal, were successive parts of an overall plan to take the emphasis away from paying dividends in the corporate sector to investment and long-termism. the very people whom he praised in that book now bear the brunt of his budgets and his failed strategy.  the chancellor says that he gave the bank of england its independence so that it would be free to control inflation, that high sterling is the bank's problem, and that he has done his bit."
833,3/23/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Redwood,"he certainly has: his budgets and his refusal to take a chancellor's responsibility for the pound are destroying exports, manufacturing and agriculture, and damaging savings and jobs. the main memory from this budget will be of a government who do not care about industry at all. i say at the outset that my party and i welcome a number of measures in the budget, not least the ambitious welfare reform package and the important reforms in macro-economic policy, such as the fiscal responsibility legislation, for which we called   it is designed to complement the operationally independent central bank, about which the conservatives seem to be more than a little confused."
834,3/23/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Malcolm Bruce,"nevertheless, i hope that the government will understand that my speech, inevitably, will concentrate on our concerns about the budget, particularly about the funding of public services and the weakening in labour's position on the environment. member for wokingham to endorse that policy, although i was interested that the right hon. and learned member for rushcliffe was not keen to answer my question about the operation of the independent central bank either."
835,3/23/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"on that issue, the conservatives would do best to keep quiet.  that leads us to a rather awkward weakness of labour's economic strategy, about which the argument has gone to and fro all evening. last year, the chancellor made the bank of england independent."
836,3/23/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Davis,the primary characteristic of independent central banks is a focus on inflation almost to the exclusion of everything else. that has generally created a better-than-average inflation record in countries with independent banks   but it does not come cost free. we have to provide the right balance between fiscal and monetary policy.
837,3/25/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"we have tightened fiscal policy considerably and, as a result of giving the bank of england independence over the setting of monetary policy, we have also succeeded in that long-term interest rates are at their lowest for more than 30 years. that stability is precisely what british industry needs in the long term. during our 18 years in office, we gave manufacturing much more encouragement than the present government have during the past 10 months."
838,4/6/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Redwood,"we did not tax manufacturing as this government are; we did not try to wreck manufacturing by introducing an independent bank of england, and fiscal policies of the kind introduced by this government. as the right hon. gentleman has mentioned the bank of england, perhaps he will tell us whether he thinks that the present government's policy of independence would be reversed if there were ever another tory government."
839,4/6/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Redwood," will the secretary of state remind the chancellor of his fine words in opposition about how important manufacturing is to our economy? will she find the strength, at least in the privacy of government, to condemn the lethal combination of the past two budgets and the independence of the bank of england, which is forcing adjustment and the policy against inflation on to manufacturers? they will have to slim down or close down."
840,4/6/1998,Labour,labour,Mrs. Beckett,"today, the right hon. gentleman has claimed that the government were wrecking manufacturing by giving independence to the bank of england. all i can say is that the previous government managed to wreck manufacturing without giving independence to the bank."
841,4/6/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. MacShane,gentleman shook his head vigorously. i thought that it was a cardinal virtue of modern tory faith that there should be independence for the bank of england. i invite conservative members   we have some experienced business people and city experts in the chamber   to raise their hands if they think that the monetary policy committee should be abolished and control returned to the bank of england.
842,4/6/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Brian Cotter," the government talk much about stability. we welcome operational independence for the bank of england, and the fiscal stability code. both those policies were in our manifesto, if not in labour's."
843,4/6/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Brian Cotter,"we would like to hear their answer. the former conservative chancellor berates the new monetary system in the uk while supporting the single currency, which would also require an operationally independent central bank.  the tories clearly have much thinking to do, but so do the government."
844,4/7/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Fatchett,it is about time that conservative members recognised the success of british exports and started to work out their own policy. they have to tell the country whether they are in favour of the boom and bust that existed under their stewardship of the economy or whether they do not want the bank of england to have the independence that it currently enjoys. i want to hear exactly what their policy is.
845,4/8/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Michael Fabricant,"purchase), the parliamentary private secretary to the foreign secretary, in saying that interest rates must be reduced to preserve manufacturing? the only way to reduce interest rates is by ending the political situation whereby the bank of england is a halfway house: it is neither independent, nor fully controlled by the government, as interest rates and the inflation rate have been set for purely political ends. lords amendment no."
846,4/20/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nick Gibb," one of the other great paradoxes and difficulties in the bill could be eased if we were to include in the required statement of strategy some explanation relating to the inherent conflict between the bank's conduct of monetary policy and the government's conduct of fiscal policy. the problem with separating those functions is that, by passing control of inflation to an outside independent body, the government could conduct a loose fiscal regime and leave the bank of england to deal with the inflationary consequences. indeed, some have argued that such has been the government's record over the past 11 months."
847,4/20/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"cable) in committee and on report, which is contrary to what the chief secretary alleged. we believe that the newly independent bank of england should represent fully all the nations and regions of the united kingdom. in the spirit of our amendments, we shall support the lords amendment, which provides the only element of additional representation on offer."
848,4/20/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"mitchell). they were against the concept of independence for the bank of england in the first place, and always have been against it. it is curious that the shadow chief secretary has embraced a lords amendment that would give a voice to the first minister of the scottish parliament on something in which the right hon."
849,4/20/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Fallon," the chief secretary's argument that, because we opposed the bill in the first place, we should not now support the amendment, will not wash either. we did not want an independent bank of england of the nature that is set up by the bill but, as we are getting one, we do not see why the monetary policy committee should not better reflect all parts of the uk.  this is an amendment for openness."
850,4/21/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,i do not accept that at all. our decision to give the bank of england operational independence was absolutely right. it is one of the most open and accountable central banks anywhere.
851,4/21/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Ross Cranston," it is clear that, unless we can achieve economic stability, we shall not have stable levels of growth and employment. the government have taken several important steps to promote stability, including giving operational independence to the bank of england. as we heard again yesterday in the debate on the bank of england bill, conservative members are still not happy with that measure, although, as the hon."
852,4/21/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nick St. Aubyn,"does not the hon. gentleman recognise that, at the time that the bank of england was given its putative independence, there was a change of government? we moved from minority government to a government with a large majority."
853,4/21/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nick St. Aubyn," the government are guilty of a failure of monetary tactics. let us not forget that at the same time as the chancellor gave putative independence to the bank of england, he raised interest rates by one quarter of one percentage point. it was the chancellor   not the bank   who set in train an incremental approach to raising interest rates."
854,4/21/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. St. Aubyn," the second prong to monetary policy is the effect on the domestic consumer, who reacts in what economists would call an inelastic way to changes in monetary policy. the new chancellor said that he was giving the bank of england independence and that monetary policy would be conducted differently in future. the british consumer would last year have been entitled to assume that the bank had decided that a 0.25 per cent."
855,4/21/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. St. Aubyn,"it was the chancellor who chose to introduce a second budget in the same year, a budget which put up many duties and, with them, the rate of inflation. having just transferred the control of interest rates to the bank of england, and having given a firm injunction as to the inflation target, the chancellor forced up the rate of inflation and, literally, by those decisions, forced up the level of interest rates needed to give the monetary policy of the newly independent bank of england any sense of credibility.  it was a failure of fiscal strategy, forcing up the duties, forcing up the inflation rate, that compounded the problem, pushing up interest rates even further, and again hammering our exporters with a rising pound."
856,4/21/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Streeter,"he is right to make that point.  the first blunder was to hand over interest rate management to an independent bank of england. of course a group of professional bankers and economists, when asked to focus exclusively on hitting a specific inflation target, will always err on the side of caution."
857,4/21/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Streeter,"one can hit inflation targets if one is prepared to level the economy to do so. we warned that giving independence to the bank of england on interest rate policy was a mistake, and now the country is paying the price of that mistake. the chancellor continues with his ""not me, guy"" approach."
858,4/21/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Tony Benn,"the reality is that the framework, set by the european monetary institute and adopted by the government, is forcing a squeeze on people, who will suffer as a result.  my second point   i do not want to take too long   relates to the independence of national central banks. on page 12, the report says clearly that a list of practices by governments or parliaments are
 incompatible with the treaty and/or the statute
 if they endanger institutional independence   that is, from governments or parliaments."
859,4/21/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Tony Benn," indeed, it would be incompatible with the treaty to
 approve, suspend, annul or defer decisions of national central banks;
 or to
 censor a national central bank's decisions on legal grounds"".  whatever the legislation might be, the courts would not be allowed to take action that would hamper the independence of the central banks. indeed, we cannot
 participate in the decision-making bodies of a national central bank with a right to vote""."
860,4/21/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Benn,"this is not a british objection   i would feel just as strongly if i were a frenchman, a spaniard, a greek or from any other country.  we shall have more of this when we come to the debates on the single currency, but it is important to put down a marker now, before we go along quietly approving things which are already taking place, beginning with the independence of the bank of england, and denying those who sent us here the rights that they are entitled to expect when they cast their vote. for those reasons, i shall not be able to support the motion tonight."
861,4/21/1998,Conservative,conservative,Dr. Liam Fox,"while the prime minister plays god himself, the chancellor plays pontius pilate, and an interesting play it will be at some point, but it will certainly be devoid of passion.  the first question that we need to mention following the economic secretary's opening speech this evening concerns the government's initial economic act in the parliament, which was independence for the bank of england.  our responsibility is to solve the problems of the people, and that demands an expansion of the economy to generate public spending, not cuts to achieve something that is hypothetical."
862,4/21/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Austin Mitchell,"it is not the purpose of the people to make the bank of england independent and give it control over interest rates, which have a disastrous effect on the exchange rate and on manufacturing, which is on the front line of intense international competition.  the purpose of the people is about jobs. gentleman now says that he is against independence for the bank of england."
863,4/23/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"i therefore assume that the conservative party would repeal the legislation, and we should now have a statement from the shadow chancellor to that effect. friend would agree that it is important to make the right long-term decisions for the country. we have made those decisions, such as the one giving independence to the bank of england."
864,4/23/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"i wait to hear the view of the opposition. duisenberg is under no obligation whatever to retire early, it is entirely consistent with the treaty. moreover, if the nomination of jean-claude trichet is eventually confirmed, as i expect, that will mean that two highly respected and experienced central bankers, noted for their independent views, will be in charge of the european central bank for a total of 12 years."
865,5/5/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"that is an outcome which ensures long-term stability. duisenberg had such a strong view that he should retire early, why did lunch have to go on until midnight before that became apparent to everybody?  does the prime minister recognise that, whatever the personalities and whatever the timings involved, the really disturbing thing about the row is that it shows a fundamental disagreement between participating countries about the political independence of the central bank?"
866,5/5/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. William Hague,"is it not the case that, behind the argument, lies one way, the german way, which regards the independence of the central bank as sacrosanct, and another way, the french way, which stresses the importance of a politically accountable bank? now that the prime minister has settled for an inadequate, possibly illegal and badly prepared deal, presumably he will call it the third way. gentleman, i think that the one group of people we are not entitled to take any lessons from about europe are the conservatives."
867,5/5/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"they are split down the middle as to whether they are against the euro; they are split down the middle as to whether they want it launched; and they cannot even tell us whether they are in favour of an independent central bank in respect of the euro. indeed, i think it was the right hon. friend criticises the political pressure that has been exerted on the central bank, but that is, as i understand it, the proposition for which he argues."
868,5/5/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"price stability and the independence of the bank are important, which is why it is better that the bank of england is independent to set interest rates. in the longer term, that will produce greater stability and ensure that this country does not go back to the days of boom and bust and huge fluctuations of growth followed by recession, which we had under the conservatives. if we consider the central banks not only of europe but of the world, independent central banks are better."
869,5/5/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"a strange element comes out in the remarks of members of the european parliament, of certain people at the bundesbank and of the hon. with the greatest respect to europe's central bankers, it is not their appointment, it is ours, the politicians. once the appointment has been made, it is a matter for the central bank, and it will have independence."
870,5/5/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"i therefore find odd some of the european parliament's criticism and questioning of why a political deal is being done. gentleman's political perspective argued that that was the right thing, not the wrong thing, to do.  it is important that we say to europe's central bankers: ""you have your place in this system   once nominated, you will serve, and serve independently   but you do not take the decisions on nomination."
871,5/5/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"we take the decisions."" it is important that we run essentially stable and prudent monetary and fiscal policy. that is why we gave the bank of england independence over setting interest rates."
872,5/5/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"interest rates have had to go up   rightly   to squeeze inflation out of the system. under the treaty, the politicians decide what should be the case. once appointed, it is for the central bankers to be independent."
873,5/5/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"i make no apology for the politicians having decided this. the politicians should have decided it   and we did. does the prime minister detect any logic and coherence in a political position that, first, opposes operational independence for the bank of england, secondly, criticises the appointment procedure for the president of the european central bank on the ground that it will undermine operational independence and, thirdly, opposes the general principle of a single currency because politicians will not have day-to-day control?"
874,5/5/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Bill Rammell,"do not those policy prescriptions, which, by the way, are those of the conservative party, show how far from power that opposition party is on this national and crucial issue? creating a stable foundation and a platform of monetary and fiscal stability from which industry can build is an absolute pre-condition for this government. that is why we made the bank of england independent, have set a five-year deficit reduction plan and, for the first time, have a proper long-term fiscal and monetary framework."
875,5/21/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"we are determined to avoid a return to the boom-bust, stop-go conditions of the late 1980s that lost 1 million manufacturing jobs. i part company with those monetarists who believe that effective monetary policy and parliamentary democracy are somehow indissoluble, for the same reasons that i believe in an independent judiciary and would not want politicians to make clinical judgments in the national health service. in central banks that are independent of day-to-day political control, the central bankers should be accountable, but the experience of germany and the united states shows that, when they are left to get on with the job, they have a much better effect than any succession of chancellors of the exchequer."
876,6/11/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Walter," why would the euro deliver the objective of independent monetary policy? however, the experience of the gold standard during the inter-war years should tell us that a successful economy must work within a sensitive monetary framework. an independent european central bank could provide such a framework at some time in future."
877,6/11/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Walter," the government have a duty to prepare the industry and the people of britain for the consequences of emu. the tory motion draws attention only to the legacy of the party's own policy failure and the bad old days, when interest rate policy was determined by the short-term priorities of politicians and not by the long-term interests of the country.  i find it astonishing that when operationally independent central banks are in place the world over   in almost every country in the free world   it is only the british conservative party that wants to go back to the political manipulation of interest rates."
878,6/29/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Malcolm Bruce,"that gave us entry into the exchange rate mechanism at the wrong moment   black wednesday   and the inflationary pressures under the previous government, yet the conservative party wants a return to the right of politicians to meddle in the short-term, day-to-day management of the economy and so damage the national interest.  in this context, the current chancellor is to be congratulated on giving operational independence to the bank of england and on his code for fiscal stability which, we hope, will entrench sensible rules for public borrowing. both those changes should provide greater economic stability, lower inflation, lower interest rates and higher employment."
879,6/29/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Malcolm Bruce,"certainly, that is the justification for putting them in place.  as i argued on behalf of the liberal democrats before and during the last general election, long-term interest rates have already fallen directly because of expectations of lower inflation, which has resulted from the operational independence of the central bank. if we secure lower levels of public borrowing, it means that when shocks to growth do occur   continued steady growth cannot be guaranteed   there is greater flexibility for fiscal policy and less risk of destabilising policy adjustments."
880,6/29/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce," apart from the discontinuity of statistics, there have, of course, been some controversial reactions to government policies. some have argued that the bank of england, given its operational independence, has put up interest rates too sharply. others say that the rise has come a bit too slowly."
881,6/29/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce," where the chancellor has genuinely put the economy first, he has done well. the operational independence of the bank of england is the best example. where politics have come top, economic policy has been blown off course."
882,6/29/1998,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"it will have tremendous implications for the duration of the labour government and will, i believe, have very adverse effects on the british people.  the effect of giving the bank of england independent operation on interest rates is   as i have said repeatedly in the house from the moment that it was announced   to separate fiscal and monetary policy.  the fact that the government sacrificed control over monetary discipline   they can no longer determine it   means that the chancellor can pursue a laxer fiscal policy than he otherwise could."
883,6/29/1998,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"i suppose that he was so keen to give the bank of england independence over interest rates because he knew that, sooner or later, political pressures would force him to increase public expenditure, contrary to the pledges that he gave before the general election   he wanted to be able to blame another body for the increase in interest rates. there have already been six increases in interest rates since the general election, as the motion points out, and there are undoubtedly more to come. davies)."
884,6/30/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Geoffrey Robinson,"however, generally, the conservative party is no longer seriously suggesting that, in the unlikely and impossible event of its ever being in government again, it would repeal the changes that we have introduced, be it the independence of the bank of england, the code for fiscal stability or the abolition of tax credits to make a level playing field to encourage investment.  the government have largely won the argument. no one will do that."
885,6/30/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Geoffrey Robinson,there is no real argument for ending the operational independence of the bank of england and returning its powers to the treasury. the issue before us is the narrow point in new clause 5. that would not be sensible at all.
886,7/8/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"the economic policy that the government are pursuing is to make sure that we have monetary stability, which is why we gave the bank of england independence to set interest rates, which have had to go up   they should have gone up before the election and they have had to go up since in order to squeeze out inflation. we will also ensure financial stability through curing the budget deficit. i have no doubt about that; and i have no doubt, either, that it is ultimately in the best interests of industry, although i understand the concern about the short-term problems that have resulted from the rising pound."
887,7/13/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Redwood,"i am saying that the opposition would follow policies that would produce lower interest rates, even from a so-called independent bank of england. i will set out at some length the way in which we think the government, even now, should do that. the bank would then be less worried about inflation taking off in the shops and the service sector, and would not need to panic about interest rates as it has to now, given the awful policies followed by the present government."
888,7/13/1998,Labour,labour,The President of the Board of Trade and Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mrs. Margaret Beckett),"i beg to move, to leave out from ""house"" to the end of the question, and to add instead thereof:
 welcomes the measures the government has taken to build an economy which is healthy and sustainable in the long term, including placing the control of interest rates with the independent bank of england; notes that over the last 12 months investment has grown by 7 per cent., 14,000 manufacturing jobs have been created and the public finances have been put in order; welcomes the new culture of partnership in industrial relations which is developing within the framework of measures and proposals the government is taking forward; urges the government to continue its own productive partnership with both business and employees; and condemns the opposition for its own record in government of allowing manufacturing to decline within a boom and bust economy of unprecedented proportions and actively and sustainedly destroying partnership and democracy in the workplace.  from the outset, i must say that i fear that i am likely to disappoint the right hon. i believe that the chancellor was right to set up the monetary policy committee, and i said so before the election."
889,7/13/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. MacShane,"i think it remarkable that our country did not adopt such a course years ago, because   for social democratic netherlands, or capitalist united states   independence for the central bank is a given. the fact that, when in power, the opposition baulked at that decision shows their lackadaisical approach to policy making. inflation was occurring not in the manufacturing sector, but in the high street."
890,7/13/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Page," i have no objection to monetary policy being handed over to the bank of england, but fiscal policy should not be operated completely independently and with a set of blinkers. the aeroplane analogy of the hon. gentleman raises some interesting issues."
891,7/13/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Sheerman,"i thought that he was arguing against an independent central bank. the fact of the matter is   let us not be party political about this   that britain's record, under all parties, in handling its currency has been a disgrace. afterwards, we produced a vision statement that said that we should have a sound currency, low inflation and a climate in which business can thrive."" i assume that the bank of england has retained that vision statement."
893,7/14/1998,Labour,labour,The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gordon Brown)," last may, we imposed a two-year spending limit, and we have kept to this limit.  the conservatives should now face the fact that they were responsible for the inflation that has entered the system, and that we have had to deal with it. they had better tell us whether they support the independence of the bank of england."
894,7/14/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"do they support the action that was taken on interest rates? we have put in place two fundamental long-term economic reforms to ensure that we get long-term sustainable economic growth, and to ensure that public spending is affordable.  first, we had to deal with the previous government's failure to deal with inflation, which was left rising out of control, so we gave independence to the bank of england, with the result that our long-term interest rates are the lowest that they have been for 33 years."
895,7/16/1998,Labour,labour,The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Alistair Darling),"secondly, to impose a new framework of financial discipline, we have adopted fiscal rules that achieve a current budget balance and a prudent level of debt to national income. the reserves are not big enough, so it seems inevitable that there will be a clawback from elsewhere, or the figures for years two and three will rise unless savings are made in the existing three-year programmes. i have a feeling that this is a reform   like giving independence on interest rates to the bank of england   that the government may regret in due course."
896,7/16/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. John MacGregor,"i warn that i think that the reserves are too small. affordability is directly related to fiscal policy, which must be seen in terms of its relationship with monetary policy. given the bank of england's independence on monetary policy, if public spending rises out of control, as may well happen, and if inflation is the outcome of the expenditure release, interest rates will go up."
897,7/16/1998,Conservative,conservative,Michael Spicer,"that will result in a conflict of policy for the government, with inevitable implications for affordability. we accept that it is a necessary precondition for a good investment climate. we welcomed the government's decision to give operational independence to the bank of england as a step towards achieving such a climate   we naturally welcomed that measure, as it is our policy."
898,7/21/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"however, we deplore the unbalancing effect of the government's fiscal policy. gentleman has been in the chamber until now, but i may give way to him later.  that is why we gave the bank of england operational independence and we now have the lowest   "
899,7/22/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"no, i do not agree with that at all. perhaps he will now answer this question when he rises to the dispatch box. for over a year, the tories have failed to tell us whether they support the independence of the bank of england or oppose it, and whether they would have raised interest rates at all since the election."
900,7/22/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"perhaps, in the interests of debate, we can now have an answer to those questions. it is time that the conservatives faced the challenge of moving the economy from stop-go, which we had under them, to stable and sustained growth. that is why we made the bank of england independent."
901,7/23/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,would the right hon. gentleman keep the bank of england independent? we have given him a list of the social security changes.
902,7/29/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"he still does not tell us whether there is a single one of those that he supports or opposes   indeed, he still will not tell us whether he supports the independence of the bank of england or not, whether he supports any interest rate rises or not or whether he supports the minimum wage or not. he is all very well at the level of generality, but when it comes to specifics, he is mr. the latter was also, in effect, on the same side as me, when we, alone except for angela rumbold, fought in committee for sunday trading and for ordinary people throughout the country who thought that they should not be dictated to by the nanny state."
903,7/29/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Michael Fabricant," the biggest example of style or spin, and one that i believe is an attempt to mask the government's biggest mistake, is the so-called independence of the bank of england. it is not truly independent. alan greenspan enjoys an independent federal reserve in washington."
904,7/29/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Michael Fabricant,"""independent"" means that he can set interest rate and inflation targets; but the bank of england has no such authority in the united kingdom.  eddie george has to act like a high street bank manager, obeying memos from the chancellor saying, unreasonably, that inflation targets should stay as they are while they drift up slightly in europe and the united states of america. the chronic instability of the pound sterling is one root cause of the industry's problems."
905,10/21/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Denis MacShane," the united states, germany, the netherlands and other european countries with successful steel industries all operate with interest rates set by independent central banks. the pound yo-yoed even more violently before may 1997 than it does today. member for rotherham talking about the damage that exchange rate volatility can do to a company such as british steel."
906,10/21/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Prior,"i share some of those concerns, but, by pursuing high interest rates and giving independence to the bank of england, his government have increased the value of our currency above it should be. i agree with the hon. we inherited borrowing that was out of control; we brought it under control."
907,10/21/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"yes, giving the bank of england independence was a difficult decision, but it is right in the long term. that is why long-term interest rates are at their lowest for 30 years. gentleman's party is now committed to reversing bank of england independence."
908,10/21/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"that would be a terrible mistake for the interests of the country.  [interruption.] the conservative party says that it opposes all the spending in general, but it applauds it all in particular. it wants inflation taken out of the system, but without bank of england independence   although it now says that it will retain it."
909,10/21/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"the great black hole is the space where the conservative party's brain used to be. i beg to move,
 that this house notes that the macro-economic policies of this government have led to an uncompetitive and unstable pound, high real short-term interest rates and an unbalanced economy, that as a consequence of these problems, and the recent global economic slowdown, economic growth forecasts for the uk for 1999 are being revised downwards and unemployment forecasts are being revised upwards, that jobs in manufacturing industry are already being lost at the rate of over 300 per day and that agricultural employment is also declining sharply; and calls upon the chancellor of the exchequer to resist pressures and temptations to compromise the operational independence of the bank of england, recognise the role of fiscal policy in stabilising economic growth in order to avoid excessive reliance on interest rates for such a purpose, make an early declaration of intent of the government's commitment to join the european single currency, agree and establish a joint six-monthly report on convergence by the treasury and the bank of england to the treasury committee, take further actions to tackle skills shortages, and maintain the recent plans for additional investment in key public services such as the nhs and schools.  i begin by warmly welcoming the chief secretary and the economic secretary to their new responsibilities."
910,10/26/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"the chancellor has talked tough about ending boom and bust   he talks of little else. he has done many good things that we have supported, such as giving operational independence to the bank of england. i shall certainly deal with that   if the hon."
911,10/26/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,"in the light of unsustainable growth, rising inflationary pressure and high public borrowing, we have put in place a platform of stability on which to build an economy that is capable of sustained and steady growth. we established a new and more credible framework for monetary policy by giving independence to the bank of england in setting interest rates. interest rate decisions are now taken in line with the long-term needs of the british economy rather than the short-term political considerations of a particular political party."
912,10/26/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,"and britain now has the lowest long-term interest rates for 35 years.  however, the independence that we have given to the bank of england in setting interest rates has caused confusion among conservative members. the leader of the opposition declared that he opposed independence, and said:
 they have given up control of interest rates when they should have kept hold of them."
913,10/26/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers," that view is shared by the shadow trade and industry secretary. however, the deputy leader of the opposition has said that no knee-jerk decisions should be taken regarding the independence of the bank of england. that reflected the views of the shadow chancellor a few weeks ago, who said that taking back control over interest rates was
 not a decision to rush into."
914,10/26/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers," however, last week, the shadow chancellor said that he, too, opposed bank of england independence. he said:
 we would not have given up control of interest rates in the first place"".  so there is a degree of confusion on the part of the shadow chancellor."
915,10/26/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable,"i welcome the minister's strong, robust reaffirmation of the government's decision to make the bank of england independent, but will he explain why, given that independence, the chancellor of the exchequer feels it necessary to give the bank unsolicited advice on interest rates? i am happy to discuss productivity. the new deal would be scrapped, denying hope to tens of thousands of young and long-term unemployed people."
916,10/26/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,"they would also take away the bank of england's independence and play politics with interest rates.  what we have witnessed in the past few weeks has not been a coherent and thought-out response, but political positioning to be the new darling of the right. the result is a significant lurch to the right."
917,10/26/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,"the tory party is now the party that likes to say no   no to the social chapter, to the working time directive, to the national minimum wage, to independence for the bank of england, to the working families tax credit, to the new deal for the unemployed and to an extra Â£40 billion for schools and hospitals. as a result, it is a party with no chance of winning the next general election. it is a responsibility that we intend to discharge so that, together, our country and our people can meet the challenges that lie ahead."
918,10/26/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Malcolm Bruce,"this is an important issue, because the bill to make the bank of england independent is now an act, and is a matter of law. is the conservative party committed to taking the bank of england back under political control   yes or no. gentleman some of the answers he seeks when he apologises for deceiving the electors in his constituency."
919,10/26/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Heathcoat-Amory,"he stood on a manifesto and a promise not to give independence to the bank of england, but within days of taking his seat in the current parliament he broke that promise. when will the hon. heathcoat-amory)."
920,10/26/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Christopher Leslie,"when asked a simple question about what the conservative party would do about bank of england independence, he told us, ""we will answer you only when you answer this, that and the other question."" does the right hon. gentleman realise how ridiculous he looked today? his speech was pathetic."
921,10/26/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Christopher Leslie," if conservative members are able to take decisions so quickly on matters such as the single currency, why on earth cannot they take a decision on whether to reverse bank of england independence? they really have to answer that question. we know that the right hon."
922,10/26/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Leslie,member for wells is against the euro and against the independence of the bank of england. what spending cuts would he make? gentlemen will take a stab at answering this question.
923,10/26/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Loughton,"will he commit himself and the labour party to retaining the independence of the bank of england after the next general election, or will that independence have been abdicated to the central european bank by then? gentleman has a funny way of answering a question about whether the conservative party would reverse the bank of england's independence. labour members made the bank independent, and independence is working well."
924,10/26/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"rather than sort it out himself, however, he decided to hand responsibility to the bank of england. in my view, he botched the job as he did not make the bank of england fully independent, but created a halfway house. he gave most of the members of the monetary policy committee three-year terms and, as a result, they have been over-anxious to bare their monetary teeth and prove their anti-inflationary credentials."
925,10/26/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. James Plaskitt,"on interest rates, does the hon. gentleman not accept that the bank of england, operating independently, has taken the inflationary pressures that we inherited from the previous government out of the economy by taking rates to 7.5 per cent? does that not compare favourably with the record of the previous administration who, on three separate occasions when interest rates were under political control, took interest rates to 14 per cent."
926,10/26/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie," [interruption.] i understand that it was 15 per cent.  now we have the result of the initial decision to give the bank of england independence in a form that led it to tighten monetary policy. there has been a rapid slowdown in the economy, a rise in sterling, the collapse of manufacturing, as well as falls in exports and increases in unemployment."
927,10/26/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"the chancellor's acolytes are on to the press to persuade the bank to cut interest rates sharply and there are calls for the resignation of the governor from a number of labour members.  one minute the newly independent bank of england was the most visible symbol of new labour and the next minute it is a stumbling block to downing street's preferred economic policy. first, we were told that monetary policy was too loose; then we were told that it was too tight."
928,10/26/1998,Labour,labour,Jacqui Smith,"the government have turned such spending around.  if the government had not granted the bank of england independence in setting interest rates, we would still be facing a political-risk premium on long-term interest rates instead of their being at their lowest for 35 years. on that issue, we once again see contradictions in the conservative opposition's policy."
929,10/26/1998,Scottish National Party,Others,Mr. John Swinney,"member for hackney, north and stoke newington   the government have absented themselves from setting an effective fiscal policy that could counterbalance the pursuit of that monetary policy by the bank of england. the indications of what the government are prepared to do, and what they were prepared to do when they came to office, to address any aspects of economic management have been compromised by the government's unwillingness to address fiscal issues, and by their willingness to hand power to an independent bank of england.  there is a contradiction in the arguments that have been advanced on that subject."
930,10/26/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Davey,"ashdown) said in reply to the chancellor back in july last year, instead of shackling businesses, the chancellor should restrain the consumer in order to prevent high interest rates.  of course liberal democrats support the independence of the bank of england. that policy, borrowed from our manifesto, is essential."
931,10/26/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Davey,"our government still have not made up their mind. apparently the single currency is a good thing in principle   no doubt like central bank independence and manufacturing industry. however, in practice, the government dither, dodge and duck."
932,10/26/1998,Labour,labour,Ms Hewitt,let me remind her and the house of some of the differences. by giving the bank of england operational independence we have achieved the lowest long-term interest rates for 35 years. we have brought down corporation tax to the lowest rate for 30 years.
933,10/26/1998,Labour,labour,Ms Hewitt, the hon. member for kingston and surbiton (mr.davey) appeared unable to say whether we had given too much or too little independence to the bank of england. he repeated a concern raised by other hon.
934,10/26/1998,Labour,labour,Ms Hewitt," as i hope the hon. gentleman would agree, an independent central bank is the best way to ensure the long-term credibility of this country's monetary policy. given what the hon."
935,10/26/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Robert Smith,"gentleman has said about the fault not being the bank of england's, does he support the independence of the bank of england, now that he is happy with the way in which it is behaving? i listened to the speech by the hon. member for monmouth (mr."
936,10/26/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Michael Jack,"edwards), but i am afraid that i did not hear him denounce the independence of the bank of england, which led to the interest rate policy that has forced up sterling. that lies at the heart of the rural crisis on which this debate has touched so far. we will be affected by that."
937,10/28/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"the best way of getting through that difficulty is to hold firm to strong fiscal and monetary rules and the additional investment in education and our public services   not to cancel bank of england independence or that investment, which is his policy; that would simply lead us back to boom and bust. i assume that we just heard the right hon. gentleman's policy announcement that he wants us to scrap bank of england independence."
938,10/28/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"half the conservative members are nodding their heads and the other half shaking them. however, as i also told him last week, a net 400,000 additional jobs have been created. his alternative, cancelling investment in schools and hospitals next year and cancelling bank of england independence, would be a disaster for the british economy."
939,10/28/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"when his policies were last implemented, interest rates were at 15 per cent. secondly, with the coming slowdown and the world economic situation that i have described to him, our choice is to adopt either the policies that we have adopted or the policies that he advocates. the question therefore is: is scrapping bank of england independence the right thing for the economy?"
940,10/28/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"we say no.  those are the choices. are those policies   bank of england independence, strong fiscal and monetary rules, extra investment in our schools and hospitals, and the new deal for the unemployed   the right ones?"
941,10/28/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"we say that they are   and we still have not had an answer out of the right hon. because in the past 18 months inflation has been brought down to its target of 2Â½ per cent. and because britain has set in place a long-term monetary framework with the independence of the bank of england, britain is better placed than in the past to face the global difficulties."
942,11/3/1998,Labour,labour,The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gordon Brown),"because, too, britain has tackled its structural deficit in public finances, we are more able to steer that stable course, but as all forecasts around the world have made clear, there is acute uncertainty about the eventual outcome of global financial instability. interest rates for one whole year in the early 1990s.  because immediate action was taken, making the bank of england independent and tackling the inflationary pressures, inflation is today at our target of 2Â½ per cent."
943,11/3/1998,Labour,labour,The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gordon Brown),"i can announce that for future years our forecast is that inflation will stay on target.  long-term monetary stability is a precondition of our economic success. i reaffirm my support for the bank of england's independence, for its remit and its membership."
944,11/3/1998,Labour,labour,The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gordon Brown),"i do not believe that any political party, putting the long-term interests of britain first, will, on reflection, bring party politics and short-termism back into interest rate decisions.  a serious opposition party would tell us where it stood on the basic issues of economic policy. first, would the conservatives keep the bank of england independent?"
945,11/3/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"we say yes to that question; what is their answer? gentleman would not have made the bank of england independent    [hon. members: ""answer the question.""] i am answering the question."
946,11/3/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,gentleman would oppose the bank of england's being independent. he would have opposed our taking action to deal with the inflationary problem in the economy. that is what we have done.
947,11/3/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"as a result of the decisions that we have made, through the bank of england becoming independent and tackling inflation, we are meeting our inflation target. everyone expects us to meet that target in the time to come. i believe that, on reflection, the conservative party will change its mind, and stop opposing it."
948,11/3/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"when the record of this parliament is written, the opposition's opposition to the regional development agency proposals, the minimum wage, the working families tax credit, the independence of the bank of england and to spending sensibly on health and education will be a blot on their record for all time.  i met the chairmen of the new regional development agencies and, with the deputy prime minister, talked to them about their work. they have included the lack of capacity in the economy; therefore, every time there has been growth it has been unsustainable because of the development of inflationary pressures."
949,11/3/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"it is by tackling that problem head on   the independence of the bank of england helps that   and by creating a credible framework for action that we can begin to address the long-standing problem of stop-go.  as regards individual instances in innovation, investment, training and skills shortages, we are doing what we can, working with manufacturing industry, to deal with some of the problems it faces.  we also know   the bank of england had been saying it for the previous six months   that the previous chancellor had failed to raise interest rates when it was necessary to do so to deal with inflation."
950,11/3/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"it was exactly that problem of short-termism in the making of interest rate decisions that we dealt with by making the bank of england independent. i would have thought that, as a sensible back-bench member of parliament, the hon. it is for the same reason that forecasts have been downgraded, for example, for the united states of america   people would not call that a weak economy."
951,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"the single most important thing that we can do is hold firm to the course of economic stability; the worst thing that we could do is follow the conservative policy of slashing public spending and reversing bank of england independence. the short answer to that is no, i do not agree with the right hon. the question is: what is the best way to get us through this economic slowdown."
952,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"we say that it is to hold firm to bank of england independence, the Â£40 billion spending on health and education and the extra spending on infrastructure. we say that it is to keep in place the new deal and the working families tax credit. the shadow chancellor yesterday pinned his colours firmly to the mast."
953,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"the conservatives are now in favour of scrapping bank of england independence, cancelling the spending next year and cancelling the new deal and working families tax credit. if any of those things are wrong, let the leader of the opposition get up and say so now    [interruption.] gentleman's question."
954,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"most business men, including ones in his constituency, would prefer us to abandon any notion of policies that will lead to boom and bust, such as reversing bank of england independence. above all, they want to avoid the 7 per cent. of the world is in recession, but, in time, recovery will happen."
955,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"therefore, it is important to steer the course of stability that we have outlined, and not to engage in the panic-stricken policies of the conservative party, which would reduce the possibility of lower long-term interest rates by scrapping the independence of the bank of england and cancel the investment that we have made. at some point in time, it would be interesting to have a coherent economic policy from a coherent opposition. is he saying that the conservative party is going to go into the next election to scrap the new deal?"
956,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gordon Brown),will he confirm that he will go into the election to scrap bank of england independence? it is about time we had some answers. gentleman comes here crawling for advice on how to get out of the mess he got himself into.
957,11/4/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Maude,"if he is so interested in bank of england independence, why does he not ask the chief secretary to the treasury whether he believes in it? why does he not stop the chief secretary making gaffe after gaffe, when he stands at the dispatch box or goes on the radio telling the bank of england that it should cut interest rates? if he cares so much about bank of england independence why does he not do what the bundesbank or the american fed do   have people appointed for eight years or 14 years?"
958,11/4/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Maude,he knows that members of the monetary policy committee were appointed for three years by him and that their appointments will come up for renewal before the next election. gentleman answer the questions? will he scrap the new deal and will he scrap bank of england independence?
959,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"the leader of the opposition did not answer those questions, so will the shadow chancellor have the courage to tell us? what i shall tell the right hon. gentleman about bank of england independence is that he has made a botched job of it."
960,11/4/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Maude,"he has bungled it. he does not believe that it works and nor does the chief secretary, which is why his adviser spent his time in washington briefing, behind his hand, against the bank of england; and why the chief secretary goes on television and stands in this chamber putting pressure on the bank to change its policy and cut interest rates. they do not believe in bank of england independence, that is for sure."
961,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,Ms Stuart,gentleman has spoken of arrogant refusal. what is his position on the bank of england's independence? would the tories reverse that policy?
962,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gordon Brown),"interest rates remained in double figures for four years and one million manufacturing jobs were lost, while net borrowing increased to Â£50 billion and the national debt doubled in just four years; notes that the previous government's policies increased inequality and failed to tackle the structural weaknesses in the economy; commends this government for its decisive action to build a stable economy, introducing a new framework for monetary policy under which inflation is now at target and set to remain there and interest rates are less than half their previous peak, reducing government borrowing by Â£20 billion last year and, because of prudent management of the public finances, remaining on track to meet its tough fiscal rules and invest an additional Â£40 billion in education and health, with an extra Â£250 million for the national health service this year, addressing structural weaknesses by tackling unemployment and poverty with the new deals and tax and benefit reform, supporting british business by cutting corporation tax, doubling public investment to improve britain's infrastructure and addressing britain's productivity gap; and notes that there are now 400,000 more people in employment than at the general election and that britain is better placed to steer a course of stability in an uncertain and unstable world.  i am grateful to the opposition for today's debate, which gives us an opportunity to explain why independence of the bank of england is the right policy for britain; why international financial reform is necessary to deal with the world situation; why the welfare-to-work programme introduced by the government and the working families tax credit   which conservative members would abolish   are the right policies for britain; why there is a productivity gap that even the previous government recognised had to be dealt with, even if the shadow chancellor will not admit it; and why good, efficient public services, in which we will invest Â£40 billion over the next three years, are right, and the best thing for britain's future.  i do not think that the house or the country will take lectures from the former financial secretary to the treasury, who glossed over the fact that, between 1990 and 1992, when he was financial secretary, interest rates were without exception above 10 per cent."
963,11/4/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. William Cash,"does not the chancellor accept that the real reason for the catalogue that he has just set out is that we mistakenly stayed in the exchange rate mechanism for far too long? furthermore, are not the policies that he is pursuing, including the granting of independence to the bank of england, in pursuit of a policy that means that we will no longer have control over our economy? both he and the secretary of state for trade and industry clearly committed themselves to that policy at the recent cbi conference."
964,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"gentleman asks about the bank of england and monetary policy. by making the bank of england independent, we have set in place a long-term monetary framework for this country. it is the first building block of an economic strategy for the future."
965,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"the shadow chancellor says that that must all be changed. in other words, his policy is to scrap independence of the bank of england    as the chancellor has made such a mess of it, it cannot be left as it is."
966,11/4/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Maude,"if he could not tell the country what his policy was three days before the election, we shall not outline our final policy three years in advance. however, one thing that is for certain is that, because he has botched and bungled independence of the bank of england, it cannot be left as it is. most people agree with that."
967,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"i shall give way to someone who supports a central bank, even if it is an independent central bank in europe. i did not seek to intervene on that point. however, i happen to believe in the liberty of back benchers to be attracted by the independence of the bank of england."
968,11/4/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Clarke,"i know of no independent central bank whose membership comprises full-time officials of the bank of england plus academic economists who are friends of the chancellor and his advisers, nor a central bank that has made such mistakes as unnecessarily to raise our interest rates to the highest level in the developed world to avoid an inflationary boom that was never a danger.  in reply to my hon. the answer to that is to have a credible long-term framework for monetary policy."
969,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"i am glad that he now agrees that there is an attraction in the independence of the bank of england.  perhaps now conservative members can resolve this problem among themselves. gentleman knows, i have made several speeches in the previous parliament and in the present one explaining why i wholly oppose an independent central bank, but i speak for myself."
970,11/4/1998,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"assuming that the bank remains independent, may i put this important point to him   a technical point that he should consider? as he has made clear publicly, he wants those criteria changed to include growth and employment.  if we had to go on with an independent central bank, which i hope we will not, can we not move at least to change its criteria, so that it has to take account of growth and employment, and becomes much more like the federal reserve bank in the united states, which does not operate with such narrow criteria and instructions?"
971,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,i am grateful to the hon. gentleman for entering the debate about the independence of the bank of england. the conservative party now seems to be as divided on that as it is on europe.
972,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,spicer). perhaps he can tell us what the policy is on the independence of the bank of england. i was wondering what the chancellor's policy was.
973,11/4/1998,Conservative,conservative,Michael Spicer,"he has made a virtue of the independence of the bank of england, yet it seems that he is one of those who have been outed as hellbent on handing over its powers to the central bank of europe and on abolishing all its independence. how does he square those two things? we have set the five economic tests for membership of the single currency."
974,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"on the future of the bank of england, the reason why i support independence and believe that the conservative party, on reflection, will believe that it is against the national interest to scrap the independence of the bank, is because, for 30 or 40 years, this country has lacked the long-term monetary framework that is necessary for stability   long-term objectives that are set down clearly, free of party politics and short-term pressures, rules that the bank and the system have to follow, and transparency in the reporting of decisions.  one reason why long-term interest rates fell from 7 per cent. and why the differential with germany, which has been a low-inflation country, has narrowed on long-term interest rates is precisely because we made the bank of england independent."
975,11/4/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"gentleman acknowledge the curious position of the conservative party on this issue? the only major country in the g7    indeed, in the western world   that still does not have an independent central bank is japan, which the shadow chancellor has been pointing out is locked in a serious slump, and is hardly an ideal role model for having a bank that is under political control.  nevertheless, will the chancellor acknowledge that the shortness of the appointments to membership of the monetary policy committee has been a genuine issue?"
976,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"we have not heard what the conservatives would do. would they scrap the independence of the bank of england? if they cannot answer that question soon, nothing in their economic policy has any credibility."
977,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,gentleman is getting very excited   and more and more red   but he does not seem able to answer the one question that the house is waiting for him to answer: would he scrap the independence of the bank of england? the conservatives cannot have a credible economic policy unless they can tell us their position on monetary policy and the independence of the bank of england. i was confused by the direction of the conservative attack.
978,11/4/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Malcolm Bruce,"the chancellor pressed the opposition for clarification on several occasions on the subject of the bank of england without receiving any coherent answer. the rhetoric appears to be that it was wrong to give the bank of england independence and that it should be taken back under political control, which should then be used to reduce interest rates regardless of the implications for inflation. that is a classic example of treating the economy of a family or a business as if it were the economy of a nation."
979,11/4/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"the chancellor has not acknowledged that fact; he certainly has not admitted that it has anything to do with his policies.  liberal democrats support the independence of the bank of england. we believe that it is unwise for ministers inadvertently or deliberately to lean on the bank, as that could be counterproductive."
980,11/4/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Christopher Leslie,"they play games and throw mud without ever saying how they would change things. would they reverse the bank of england's independence? we heard policy-making on the hoof from the shadow chancellor when he tried to answer that question, until the hon."
981,11/4/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Leslie,we have just heard that conservative policy has changed again within the past hour. the opposition were not going to announce what they would do about bank of england independence until after the next election. now the hon.
982,11/4/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Leslie," the government have put us on the right course to the sustainable, high-productivity, high-growth economy that we all want by setting domestic fiscal policy, committing themselves to public spending and the capital expenditure that we know is so important. the monetary policy framework has been set out, with independence for the bank of england so that stable, long-term objectives can be met.  the real irony of this debate has been that for the past two hours, labour members, including the hon."
983,11/4/1998,Conservative,conservative,Michael Spicer,"member for shipley, have been jumping up and down like a jack-in-a-box defending the independence of the bank of england and asking all sorts of rude questions of us. yet they are the same people   including the chancellor, to whom i put this question in an intervention   who are hellbent on abolishing the independence of the bank of england and handing over its reserves and powers to the european central bank. it is an enormous hypocrisy on the part of the government and the governing party to pretend to take the line that they do when they are hellbent on abolishing the independence of the bank of england."
984,11/4/1998,Conservative,conservative,Michael Spicer," those who have not been jumping up and down defending the independence of the bank of england are likely to be those such as the chief secretary who are muddled about the exact nature of that independence.  we are in good shape to face a slowdown in the world economy because the government have cut debt and controlled expenditure and inflation, and interest and exchange rates are beginning to fall. if the conservatives were in power, with their resistance to the independence of the bank of england and current interest rates, inflation would go out of control and, in the midst of a downturn in the global economy, they would increase interest rates at the worst time while cutting back on public expenditure on health and education."
985,11/4/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Davies,that would be a disaster. members want to speak.  the first of the government's main planks for tackling economic developments has been to introduce monetary stability through the independence of the bank of england.
986,11/4/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Davies,"that means that interest rates are now responding to the global environment rather than the domestically created environment, as under the howe and lawson recessions. there would be no increase in opportunities for affordable work, so people would languish on the dole. there would be no bank of england independence, so interest rates would have been held back for political reasons, then jacked up as the world economy slowed."
987,11/4/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Davies,"finally, there would be savage cuts in health and education. leslie) gets very excited and asks whether conservative members would take away the bank's independence. that question will probably be irrelevant because, if the chancellor has his way, the bank of england will have no independence, its functions having been transferred to europe."
988,11/4/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Townend,"we should certainly like to take away the independence of the european central bank and maintain our own independence.  interest rates are the chancellor's responsibility. when the house has debated the record and policies of chancellors, it has debated the mix between monetary and fiscal policy: whether he is going for a tight monetary policy with a tight fiscal policy, or some other combination."
989,11/4/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"since the government made the bank of england independent, with the possibility of the euro down the track, our debates on the economy have changed. we welcome that, but what the house has not caught up with is the different ways in which fiscal policy can be actively used to affect the management of the economy. they have set a framework for the long-term direction of fiscal policy, which we welcome, but they have not made clear how they envisage the role of fiscal policy in the short and medium terms."
990,11/4/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"that is an important theoretical issue, with practical implications because of the independence of the bank of england and the way in which fiscal policy, set in the short and medium terms, affects its decisions.  there are three ways in which fiscal policy helps in managing the economy.  similarly, the rhetoric of today's chancellor is important in relation to the decisions that private sector agents take."
991,11/4/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"of course, with the independence of the central bank, the chancellor's rhetoric is also important in relation to the bank's decisions.  i am glad that the house has allowed me to explain the process in which fiscal policy affects economic management.  it is now time the government looked at the way in which fiscal policy can be used to support the economy in the short and medium terms."
992,11/4/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Davey,"they have had many reviews to do with fiscal policy and launched many papers about how it should be set for the long term; but with an independent central bank and with monetary union a not too distant prospect   i hope   the government need to revisit fiscal policy theory and decide whether they are prepared to use fiscal policy actively to promote the interests of this country. gentleman incorrectly says that we have not stated our fiscal policy proposals. if he is so concerned about opposition parties stating their policies, will he tell the house the conservative party's policy on the independent central bank?"
993,11/4/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Heathcoat-Amory,"that is why we opposed the bill. by the way, the legislation has not resulted in an independent bank of england. if that is what the hon."
994,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt),"it certainly revealed in the first half hour that the conservative party will shortly have to find another shadow chancellor.  the conservatives have made it very clear today that they are saying no to bank of england independence, no to Â£40 billion extra spending on health and education, no to the minimum wage, no to the new deal for unemployed people, no to the working families tax credit, which will make work pay, no to parental leave, no to fair standards for working people, and no to the single currency   even if it is best for british people and their jobs. most revealingly, we heard from the shadow chancellor that the conservatives are even saying no to protecting the basic pension against inflation."
995,11/4/1998,Labour,labour,Ms Hewitt,"i realise that the hon. gentleman has not been present for most of the debate, but perhaps he would like to tell us where he stands on independence for the bank of england. we have given the bank of england the responsibility to take the tough decisions that are needed to keep inflation under control, and we will back it in the decisions it makes."
996,11/5/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"gentleman will agree that the most important thing that the government can do is to create a long-term framework for monetary and fiscal stability. that is exactly what we have done by making the bank of england independent, tackling the inflationary pressures in the economy and cutting the fiscal deficit by Â£20 billion. of course we must work with business to tackle any barrier to productivity that exists in our economy."
997,11/5/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"friend will make his own points. we have made the bank of england independent, and we will support it in all the difficult decisions that it makes. the bank of england's notice states that the international environment and the prospects for domestic activity have led the committee to make its decision."
998,11/5/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"for one year as a result of the failure to tackle inflationary pressures. the former chancellor said that he was ready to consider independence for the bank of england, and we are in a better position to make adjustments now because we have created that long-term framework. i have always said, and i think that the right hon."
999,11/5/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"we took action immediately and, because we did so, inflation is at its target.  i am pleased that the former chancellor is now ready to consider independence for the bank of england. it is a pity that the rest of the conservative party has not joined him yet on this, as it has not on other issues."
1000,11/5/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"it is because we have created a long-term framework for this country that we are able to reduce interest rates. i hope that, in time, the opposition will see the wisdom of making the bank of england independent. is it now clear that not even the bank of england believes the chancellor's fantasy forecasts?"
1001,11/5/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"it is about time that, instead of making comment after comment   later proven to be untrue or incorrect   the shadow chancellor woke up to the fact that there is a global downturn and that the government are dealing with it by steering a course of stability. it is also about time that the shadow chancellor gave us a straight answer on the first issue of economic policy   whether his monetary policy is that the bank of england remains independent. until we get a straight answer on his support or otherwise for bank independence, he will have absolutely no credibility."
1002,11/5/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown," working families tax credit will help 1.5 million people, but the conservatives oppose it. bank of england independence gives us economic stability, but the conservatives oppose it. it is time they woke up to the fact that in the modern world we must make the changes that the labour party is making."
1003,11/5/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,the conservatives failed. when the chancellor next meets the governor of the bank of england will the chancellor ask him to prepare and publish a report for the house on how he would like to see the bank of england's independence strengthened? will the chancellor ask him for his views on the model of central bank independence contained in the maastricht treaty   a treaty agreed to and signed on behalf of this country by the shadow chancellor of the exchequer?
1004,11/5/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"this comes back to the central question: unless hon. members make up their mind, on macro-economic policy and monetary policy in particular, and decide whether or not they support the independence of the bank of england, they have no credibility in terms of their economic policy. the former chancellor of the exchequer is facing up to that fact."
1005,11/5/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,"we are able to forecast that growth figure because the economy is well placed as a result of the tough decisions that the government took last year. we have given independence to the bank of england   we have not heard the shadow chancellor confirm whether the conservatives would continue that arrangement   reduced the deficit by Â£20 billion and ensured that we have strong and robust public finances. that is what we have done, and i think that it is unfortunate that the hon."
1006,11/5/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Ian Bruce,"i am sure that, even before she became a member of parliament, the hon. lady will have followed the debate about the independence of the bank of england. we were all told that the one plus that would result was that real interest rates   the difference between the rate of inflation and the interest being paid   would go down."
1007,11/5/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Ian Bruce,"since the independence of the bank of england, people have been paying three times the rate of inflation. why? if she will forgive me, rather than give a direct answer now i shall address those points in my speech; the house will understand my speech better if i am allowed to deal with those points in the order that i see fit."
1008,11/10/1998,Conservative,conservative,Miss Kirkbride," the longbridge plant suffered particularly from the high exchange rate resulting from the government's decision to make an independent bank of england which misjudged the rate at which interest rates should be set because it was not capable of knowing the government's wider economic policy. interest rates were kept too high for too long with the result that the pound shot through the dm3 ceiling, which i cannot remember its reaching before. the first point, which i hope will not be lost on the minister, is that the government's economic policy has some bearing on the situation."
1009,11/10/1998,Conservative,conservative,Miss Kirkbride,"i notice that, for all the protestations that the bank of england is independent, treasury ministers at least have recently asked it to listen to their pleas for a reduction in interest rates which, to the satisfaction of the house, is what we had last week. would the hon. lady suggest that independence for the bank of england be scrapped?"
1010,11/10/1998,Conservative,conservative,Miss Kirkbride,"it is difficult to say that the bank of england is truly independent when members of the monetary policy committee are appointed by the government on relatively short-term contracts. independence is not as clear cut as it might be in america and germany. that is more than three times the rate of inflation, which is why we have great problems with investment in this country."
1011,11/10/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce,"if independence for the bank of england gives us that, i for one would say, ""it is proven; we were right not to give it independence."" by the next general election, we will be able to judge whether we should bring the bank back into political control.  if people do not believe my arguments, they should page the parliamentary data and video network and look up peter shore. he made the same speech on the bank of england almost all the time, and his speeches would persuade labour members, as well as conservative members, that independence for the bank of england was no panacea."
1012,11/10/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Bruce," what about this unsustainable growth of 3 per cent. the question is, given the difficulties for jobs and industry over the next year, what is the right policy? we say that new fiscal and monetary rules and bank of england independence are right."
1013,11/11/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"the choice is simple: what is the best way in which to steer a course of stability in the year ahead? we repeat that the best way is to make the investments that we have made, to tackle the problems of social exclusion as we are doing and to hold firm to bank of england independence. i believe that that position is supported by the vast majority of people in this country, who do not want a return either to underfunded public services or to the boom and bust of the conservatives."
1014,11/18/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Loughton,"one of the recommendations of the select committee on environmental audit was to set up a green-tax commission. the government have gone the route of a monetary policy committee and independence, in certain terms, for the bank of england. surely a green-tax commission that is independent of political interference could bring some benefits."
1015,11/18/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Loughton,"i look forward to labour ministers starting to show signs of wanting to catch us up soon. if the prime minister is serious about securing economic stability, does he accept that it requires not just an independent bank of england, but a strategy for stabilising exchange rates and bringing our interest rates closer into line with already low european rates? is not that failure of policy the reason why today's treasury survey of independent economic forecasts shows that manufacturing industry is predicted to decline sharply next year, contrary to the chancellor's forecasts?"
1016,11/18/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"the question is: what is the right way to get through this? we believe that bank of england independence and keeping tight control of fiscal policy   which we have done, slashing the enormous budget deficit that we inherited from the conservatives   are the right things to do. if we combine them with measures to improve working conditions for people, such as the working families tax credit and the new deal, on which the oecd report today specifically congratulates us, we have the best chance of weathering the storm."
1017,11/18/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"i believe in a sustained period of wooing before relationships are entered into. what business wants above all is to know that the government are going to hold to bank of england independence and tight fiscal policy, making the additional investment in infrastructure, schools and hospitals next year.  in the past few weeks the conservatives have provided the country with a simple choice."
1018,11/18/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"they would scrap bank of england independence, they oppose our investment in schools and hospitals next year, they would scrap the working families tax credit and they would scrap the new deal. that is their decision. gentleman would scrap bank of england independence; he would scrap the Â£40 billion investment in our schools and hospitals; he would scrap the working families tax credit revenue deal; but he will die in the ditch to save the hereditary peers."
1019,11/24/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister (Mr. Tony Blair), i gather that the right hon. let me see whether i can liven conservative members up. is any one of them prepared to tell us what the tory position now is on bank of england independence?
1020,11/24/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"is any one of them prepared to tell us whether they oppose the new deal? let us not forget that we inherited a situation where inflation was predicted by the bank of england to rise above 4 per cent., and where the budget deficit under the conservatives was Â£28 billion. we therefore introduced bank of england independence, followed by new fiscal rules to control and to cut borrowing."
1021,11/24/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"we put through the two toughest financial years that any government have done for a long time, and we did that precisely so that we could sort out the public finances and get the investment into our public services that we need.  the reason for drawing attention to the conservatives' record in the early 1990s is that their policies, in so far as there are any   the right hon. member for richmond, yorks did not give us any, but in so far as one can divine the policies from the shadow secretary of state for trade and industry and the shadow chancellor of the exchequer   are precisely to repeat those mistakes: cancelling bank of england independence, so returning interest rates to short-term political considerations; cancelling the additional spending; and opposing every measure that we took to cut the budget deficit."
1022,11/24/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,every one was opposed by the conservatives. the exchange rate is now back down to the level that we inherited from him.  i believe that the only way of getting long-term stability into the economy is to have bank of england independence.
1023,11/24/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"i do not know whether or not the right hon. the question is how we best meet this economic challenge as a country. i say that we do so by the new and modern rules for bank of england independence, the new fiscal framework that we have in place and the extra investment that we are making in our public services and productivity."
1024,11/24/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister," the centrepiece of the queen's speech is the set of measures to improve the health service, our schools and law and order and to reform welfare.  at each stage those proposals have been opposed and attacked by the conservative party as it retreats ever further rightwards. now, during the debate on the queen's speech, we know that conservative members oppose bank of england independence."
1025,11/24/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"conservative members are shaking their heads. the shadow secretary of state for trade and industry appears not to oppose bank of england independence, but a few months ago, he said:
 we opposed the bank of england bill in the house of commons  ¦ i and my colleagues warned about the dangers of what the government was proposing.  i had not understood that, in today's tory party, that is a statement of support."
1026,11/24/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"are conservative members opposed to bank of england independence?  the speech of the right hon.  on the economy, the key, as the prime minister said last week, is stability   how to create it and how to preserve it."
1027,11/24/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Ashdown,"the government have made good early progress towards monetary stability by granting independence to the bank of england last year, as we have long recommended. good, but are they prepared to back that up with the measures necessary for fiscal stability and exchange rate stability? those factors are a direct result of the government's mistakes on economic policy."
1028,11/25/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Jenkin," independence for the bank of england meant that interest rates rose higher and for longer than was necessary, and the british incoming tour operators association estimates that the number of overseas visitors in the current year ending in september was 4 per cent. lower than in the equivalent period for 1997, and said that the trend is still downwards.  yesterday, the right hon."
1029,11/25/1998,Labour,labour,Yvette Cooper,"gentleman shook his head vigorously when the prime minister suggested that his party wanted to reverse bank of england independence. perhaps he will clear up that point of principle now. she can read nothing into that answer, except that the opposition have been right so far."
1030,11/25/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Redwood,"they have opposed the independence of the bank of england vigorously, because so far it has been wrong. but of course we shall look carefully at the situation in 2001, when there will be so many things to put right that we shall have to choose which to put right first. when there was a conservative chancellor of the exchequer prepared to take responsibility for these matters, he took the exchange rate into account when forming interest rate judgments   and did a rather better job for manufacturing in the mid-1990s before we lost office than the labour government are able to do through their independent central bank."
1031,11/25/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Redwood,"i know which of those business would rather have at the moment. over the past two years, we have taken steps to end boom and bust   the instability of the economy that we inherited   to ensure that we can plan ahead. we gave the bank of england independence and, as a result, we have the lowest long-term interest rates for 35 years."
1032,11/26/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"the conservative party is against not only our long-term investment, but one of the key planks of our strategy for economic stability. how does the right hon. gentleman square his argument for clarity in the regulatory regime with his declared view on the media that the bank of england is either too independent or not independent enough?"
1033,12/1/1998,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"which should it be   independent or not? our new labour government are not an old-fashioned state interventionist government; nor are we saddled with an equally outdated adherence to the free market. the government have a new sense of direction that has allowed us to cut corporation tax, introduce a national minimum wage, give independence to the bank of england, find radical new ways of combating social exclusion, crack down on juvenile crime while launching the most ambitious programme to slash youth unemployment that our country has ever seen, reform student finance and deliver a record increase in the level of child benefit."
1034,12/1/1998,Labour,labour,The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Byers),"in this, our second queen's speech, we build on our first programme by pushing forward our modernisation agenda. that is one of the reasons why the sooner we get in and can bring some influence to bear, the better. that does not mean interfering in the decisions of the european central bank, or carrying out the megaphone monetary policy adopted by the newly elected politicians in germany   i suspect that they will learn a thing or two in a fairly short time   but it is about arguing that the british model of central bank independence, which i know does not command total support in the house, has something to commend itself to the continental model."
1035,12/1/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"it would provide for operational independence, but would make the european central bank much more open and accountable to public scrutiny   not open enough for the hon. member for hackney, north and stoke newington (ms abbott), but i am sure that she would agree that such transparency would be better than that which it offers.  i do not expect the tories to have a view on that."
1036,12/1/1998,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"indeed, i do not know when they will review their policy given that the shadow secretary of state for trade and industry has said that 2002 will be early enough for the tories to make up their mind whether the bank of england should stay independent. as has already been quoted, however, the shadow chancellor has certainly said that either we should have complete political control, or the bank should be completely independent. it has been difficult in recent months to meet, anywhere in the country, any industrialist of experience   certainly anyone who has worked in the exporting industries   who believes that the bank of england has been getting its monetary policy right."
1037,12/1/1998,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell," the chancellor is clearly anxious about his hasty and furtive decision to give independence to the bank of england a few days after the general election and to abandon his ministerial responsibility for monetary policy. that was not in the labour party's manifesto and it was not agreed with the then shadow cabinet before the general election. as its unwisdom becomes ever more evident, we must not forget that he is the man to blame."
1038,12/1/1998,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell," lord healey has pointed out, in his usual frank and genial way, that
 an independent central bank is a gimmick to be used as an apologia by failed chancellors to shuffle off their failures on to the bank of england.  he speaks with some authority on these matters. some exporters and farmers will never recover, but will be forced out of business."
1039,12/1/1998,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell, the decision to give independence to the bank of england has been a disastrous failure so far. the chancellor is looking more and more like philip snowden and less and less like maynard keynes.  that is exactly what is likely to happen when fiscal and monetary policies are separated.
1040,12/1/1998,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,governments run an even laxer fiscal policy to cope with social discontent and the independent central bank tightens monetary policy to offset the lax fiscal policy. one ends up simultaneously with a monetary policy that is too tight and a fiscal policy that is too loose. the one thing lacking from those who currently set interest rates is a large dollop of real-world common sense.
1041,12/1/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Jack," it should be incumbent on the government to produce a review of section 11 of the bank of england act 1998, to see whether it might be modified to give the bank   if its independent stance is to be maintained   an opportunity to take into account wider issues. another part of the 1998 act gives the chancellor the opportunity to intervene if situations merit such intervention.  what do we mean by modernisation, particularly in relation to industry and the economy?"
1042,12/1/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Mark Fisher,"in our first session, we cut corporation tax, introduced a national minimum wage and gave independence to the bank of england   all modernising and very necessary initiatives. it is in our national interest that the goods that we produce, as long as they are well designed, well marketed and competitive in every other way, should be able to compete, particularly in germany, france and italy, without being inhibited by the level of the pound.  the economy generally and manufacturing industry in particular would be helped if the government widened the remit given to the bank of england as part of its new independence to consider factors such as growth and employment as well as inflation."
1043,12/1/1998,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Christopher Fraser,"gentleman tells the house each week that the opposition are against independence for the bank of england. each week, he invites my right hon. i am hardly surprised at eccentric remarks falling from the lips of the shadow secretary of state for trade and industry, but my hon."
1044,12/2/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"friend is right to point out that the contrast is the government providing fiscal and monetary stability through bank of england independence and the new golden rules; the extra investment   Â£40 billion in health, education and other public services; and the working families tax credit and the new deal, to help low-income families and the unemployed. all are good measures for the british economy; all are opposed by today's conservative party. while the whole country welcomes what the government are doing to create economic stability, is all that not being undermined by the conservative party questioning and challenging and talking down british business   questioning the independence of the bank of england, challenging the new deal and the working families tax credit   and by the chaos that the conservative party has created in the house of lords by sacking viscount cranborne and the resignation of peter fraser?"
1045,12/9/1998,Labour,labour,Fiona Mactaggart,"friend agree that, as people await the decision of the bank of england monetary policy committee, it is worth reflecting on the difference that the independence of that body has made and comparing the present position with that of 10 years ago, at the same point in the economic cycle, when there were 1 million more people unemployed than today, when inflation was twice what it is today, when interest rates were 13 per cent. and when we had a tory government? we are, of course, hitting the inflation target, and long-term interest rates are at their lowest level for more than 30 years."
1046,12/9/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"the reason why we are able to achieve that is that we have in place bank of england independence and proper controls on spending that allow us to keep public finances under control and put an extra Â£40 billion into our schools and hospitals. as the deputy leader of the conservative party repeated just a few days ago, the conservatives are against bank of england independence, and we know that they are against our spending proposals. we are in a better position this economic cycle precisely because we have pursued the policies that they oppose."
1047,12/9/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"friend refers. the best way of dealing with whatever economic difficulties we face over the next year is to hold firm to the key policies that the government set out: proper bank of england independence, proper rules on public spending, extra investment in our future   particularly in education, skills and apprenticeships, as she rightly says   and making sure through the new deal and the working families tax credit that people have incentives to work. that is the best policy to weather any storm that comes."
1048,12/9/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,it is only through stability that individuals and businesses can plan with confidence for the future so that we can achieve the higher levels of growth and employment that we all want to see. we took action immediately on coming to office by giving the bank of england independence in setting interest rates. i am beginning to regret giving way to the hon.
1049,12/9/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,"he is always perfectly on message, as we know.  i was talking about giving the bank of england independence in setting interest rates and i thought that that was why the hon. member for buckingham (mr."
1050,12/10/1998,Labour,labour,Jacqui Smith,"despite the fact that the opposition want to reintroduce politics into the setting of interest rates, can my right hon. friend reassure me that we shall maintain the independence of the bank of england, which has brought such welcome news on interest rates today? as i have already said, the government welcome today's bank of england decision to cut interest rates by 0.5 per cent."
1051,12/10/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,"as the bank said, the reason for the cut was a weakening in global economic activity. the tough decisions that the government took to reduce the deficit by Â£20 billion, to give independence to the bank of england and to ensure that we hit the inflation target of 2.5 per cent. have enabled us to steer a course of economic stability."
1052,12/10/1998,Labour,labour,Yvette Cooper,"given that the framework for stability that the government have put in place has led to interest rates falling from a peak of just over 7 per cent., compared to a previous peak of 15 per cent., will my right hon. friend promise that he will not follow the advice of the deputy leader of the opposition to give away the bank of england's independence and have the chancellor, rather than the governor of the bank of england, taking decisions on interest rates? the time has come for the conservative opposition to reveal their position on independence for the bank of england."
1053,12/10/1998,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,"it is because we have given the bank of england independence that long-term interest rates are now at their lowest level for some 35 years and that we have today received the welcome news from the bank that interest rates are to be cut by a 0.5 per cent. it is because we will not play party politics with interest rates that we gave independence to the bank of england. it is a matter of regret that the conservatives apparently still want to have that control, which will operate only for narrow party advantage, not in the national interest."
1054,12/16/1998,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"as a result of the policies that we are pursuing, we have the best chance of getting ourselves through any economic downturn. monetary stability is in place because of the independence of the bank of england, which has given us the lowest long-term interest rates for more than 30 years. because of the changes that we made in public spending on coming to office, we were able to reduce the conservative deficit, and are able to put Â£40 billion extra into our schools and hospitals from next april."
1055,1/13/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn,low inflation is in line with the government's target. politics have been taken out of interest rates with independence for the bank of england. we have the lowest long-term interest rates in 35 years.
1056,1/20/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"we shall see progress on all the things that will help to modernise this country and make it a more just and fair society. the government are in favour of the minimum wage, the working families tax credit, bank of england independence and Â£40 billion more for health and education. the opposition are in favour of hereditary peers."
1057,1/28/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"we are steering a course of stability in a troubled world economy. the measures that we have put in place, including the independence of the bank of england   opposed still by the conservatives   were the right measures to create a long-term framework for monetary and fiscal stability. gentleman outlined is answered."
1058,2/3/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"what would be most disastrous, however, is if we were to pursue the policies that he wants pursued, including taking away bank of england independence, scrapping the new deal for young people, getting rid of the working families tax credit and doubling the national debt. the labour party will be the party of economic stability, not the boom and bust of the tories. will his reaction be the same as that to the working families tax credit, which the conservatives have pledged to reverse, resulting in a tax increase for some of the poorest people of Â£17 a week?"
1059,2/3/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Darling,"are we to hear yet another pledge, along with the one to remove the independence of the bank of england? corporate britain would be dismayed if that were the stated objective of the conservative party.  under this government, there is an entirely new framework for economic management in place."
1060,2/23/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister (Mr. Tony Blair),"bank of england independence has at long last given us credibility in interest rate decisions, as well as low interest rates. there are also new fiscal rules which the chancellor has relied on to slash the Â£28 billion borrowing requirement and ballooning national debt which we inherited and put us on a path of fiscal prudence. banks and bankers have been major contributors to deflationary policy."
1061,2/25/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Rowlands,that is why during the past 18 months to two years i have not shared the government's enthusiasm for creating an independent bank of england. i was even less enthusiastic about the creation of an independent european bank that might hold our destiny in its hands. there has been legislation to raise standards in schools.
1062,2/25/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Don Touhig,the bank of england has been given independence to set interest rates. there has been a massive shake-up in the criminal justice system   i could go on. is there not a strange dichotomy in this situation?
1063,3/3/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Ian Bruce,"the chancellor of the exchequer is not allowed to interfere with the independence of the bank of england, and the euroland nations are not entitled to interfere with the central bank. however, our chancellor is able to speak to the governor of the central bank and suggest that he should increase interest rates in euroland because the bank is currently effecting competitive devaluation of the euro for short-term gains in europe. the first issue that we need to deal with is the extent to which the position of the bank of england might now need to be changed."
1064,3/3/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Cable,"i start from the assumption   liberal democrat members strongly believe this, as i am sure do government members, and perhaps we even have a convert on the conservative benches   that the bank of england's independence is desirable and its creation was a valuable step forward.  despite many reservations among members on the liberal democrat benches and labour back benches, many of the fears about that independence have not been realised. that does not necessarily mean immediately shadowing an exchange rate or any other objective, but the committee should monitor economic convergence and begin to discuss the problem with other relevant departments, especially the minister's own."
1065,3/3/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Cable," it is important that the bank of england's independence is maintained in that process, but at some point we must confront the dilemma that the objectives of convergence may well involve moving interest rates in the opposite direction from that of domestic inflation. over the next few months, for example, the objective of convergence might best be achieved by cutting interest rates to bring down the pound. gentleman accept that his suggestion that the only way in which to achieve convergence criteria is directly to target them is contrary to what was discussed in the select committee yesterday and to the clear statement from lord simon that the government's current policies on the bank of england's independence and long-term fiscal stability are precisely those that should lead to convergence?"
1066,3/3/1999,Labour,labour,Jacqui Smith,"does not he accept that it is not necessary to have a strict objective of convergence, but that it is important that we put into place the policies that will achieve that aim? i argue that it is not. bank of england independence and a long-term approach to fiscal policy that will enable us to converge are more important."
1067,3/3/1999,Labour,labour,Jacqui Smith," i am disappointed that there has been no elucidation this morning of the conservative position, although i still hope for some. gentleman may recall the recent report by the organisation for economic co-operation and development, which said that that rate of growth was unsustainable    [interruption.] it says that the only way in which to ensure proper growth in this country is to pursue the policies for economic stability that this government have undertaken, such as bank of england independence, which conservative members oppose, the sorting out of public finances, so that we do not have the doubled national debt that we inherited, and, of course, an end to    [hon. members: ""boom and bust.""] boom and bust, exactly."
1068,3/3/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"so hundreds of thousands of young and unemployed people know that if they vote tory, they will get put out of a job. it is this government who are developing not only low interest rates and not only bank of england independence, but Â£40 billion of extra spending, and the new deal is delivering jobs where the tories delivered despair. in our first week in government, we made the bank of england independent, freeing monetary policy from the politically driven control that, in the last economic cycle, led to 15 per cent."
1071,3/9/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Paddy Ashdown,"we saw those policies clearly in the proposals for vehicle excise duty, fiscal neutrality in charging a carbon tax, and the uprating of basic pensions in line with wages.  indeed, part of our macro-economic strategy is to bring the british economy into line with european economies to make it possible to join the euro in 2001, 2002 or thereabouts. the challenge to the chancellor is to create an economic climate in which the independent bank of england can continue gradually to lower interest rates from 5.5 per cent."
1072,3/9/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Williams,"to below 3 per cent.  all of our achievement has been made with low inflation, which has been sustained at 2.5 per cent., or thereabouts. in granting the bank of england independence to set interest rates, the chancellor and the government chose very wisely to give it a symmetrical target inflation rate of 2.5 per cent."
1073,3/9/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Williams,"if inflation looked like being higher than 2.5 per cent.  considering the position of the british economy on monetary and fiscal policy is a good way to assess the impact of today's budget. inflation is clearly being brought under control, thanks to the independence granted to the monetary policy committee of the bank of england."
1074,3/9/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Christopher Leslie,"i am sure that many people will grow to appreciate that policy, when contrasted with the threat posed by the conservatives, who would probably scrap bank of england independence. the conservatives getting their grubby political hands all over monetary policy again would pose a risk to everyone's prosperity. we shall find out what their policy is in time."
1075,3/9/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Christopher Leslie,"if they do not like bank of england independence, i should like to know what they would do like. i was doing so because of an interesting quote from the company's investment manager, who said:
 the new labour government gave the bank of england operational independence  ¦ thus reinforcing their pre-election claims of economic prudence and the need for low inflation.  that quote jumped out at me because the right hon."
1076,3/9/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Leslie,"would they plug that gap by cutting public services, by adding extra to tax or by returning to increases in the national debt? what would the tories do about bank of england independence? would they scrap the Â£40 billion extra spending on schools and hospitals?"
1077,3/10/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"that is best guaranteed, first, by policies that are disciplined on public finances, which is a lesson that the liberal democrats would do well to learn   if i may attack them for a moment   and, secondly, by lower interest rates. as a result of the action that this government have taken and the independence of the bank of england, we have managed to get the lowest interest rates for 30 years. are we meant to understand from the right hon."
1078,3/10/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"gentleman's speech that, given the chance, he would reverse the independence of the bank of england, alongside his intention never to join the euro? in such a situation, long-term interest rates for british industry would rocket, there would be a huge migration of international capital out of the country and the rate of unemployment would escalate. what an extraordinary statement."
1079,3/10/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Redwood,the opposition opposed the independence of the bank of england because we did not think it was right in the circumstances. how right we were. we cannot do more than oppose a wrong idea at the moment.
1080,3/10/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Redwood,we opposed independence for the bank of england and we explained that we did so because it would do great damage to british manufacturing. our prediction has come true. it is a shame that he cannot discuss it openly.
1081,3/10/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,"he smiles because he knows that he would not have given independence to the bank of england. it is a shame that he cannot speak his mind on the issue. some people argue that the measure affects only the timing of the investment, making marginally profitable projects more viable."
1082,3/10/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Michael J. Foster,"however, coupled with the economic stability that has been brought about by bank of england independence, prudent fiscal management, an end of boom and bust and the positive growth forecast from the treasury, that continued tax relief may affect the volume and not merely the timing of the investment.  of special note is the small business service and the extra help with venture finance. global forecasts have been halved, and difficult times lie ahead; but we must face those times realistically."
1083,3/10/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies," that does not mean a repeal of the independence of the bank of england, which the right hon. gentleman seemed to be calling for and which would cause interest rates to hurtle up. friend agree that the decision taken early in the parliament to give operational independence to the bank of england has been of major strategic importance because it has engendered an environment of stability that is the absolute antithesis of the boom-and-bust cycles that were prevalent under the previous government?"
1084,3/11/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. McNulty,"i thank my hon. after all, for 18 years, they played proverbial golf with only one club in their bag. god alone knows how the conservatives would survive in government now that the bank of england is independent."
1085,3/11/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"i am terribly sorry, but i cannot take any more interventions, as i am told that i have only three minutes left. initially, to their credit, they did so. i supported their decision to make the bank of england independent, although they did not do it in the manner that i would want."
1086,3/11/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"they made a bit of a botched job of it, although it seems that they are getting away with it. we are leaving behind the instability   the boom and bust   that plagued businesses, individuals, and families in the past. we took the tough decision to make the bank of england independent: a decision opposed by the conservative party."
1087,3/15/1999,Labour,labour,The Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Alistair Darling),"the result is that inflation is low, long-term interest rates are at their lowest for more than 40 years, and mortgage rates are at their lowest level for 30 years. the way to achieve that is to put in place the conditions for economic stability. that is what we have done by giving independence to the bank of england and by ensuring that inflation falls and stays low."
1088,4/15/1999,Labour,labour,Ms Hewitt,"we now have the lowest long-term interest rates for 40 years, the lowest mortgage rates for 33 years, and the lowest rates of corporation tax ever.  ministers are keen to boast about the economic position, with some justification. we predicted that long-term interest rates would come down sharply if the bank of england was made independent."
1089,4/20/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Bruce,"that was part of our election strategy, and because the government adopted that policy that is exactly what has happened.  in some respects, the chancellor has entrenched a sense of continuity with past practice. in fact, he has gone further, particularly by introducing bank of england independence."
1090,4/20/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Andrew Tyrie,"however, bit by bit, in this budget, he is diverging from the inheritance. he is getting a reputation for being a chancellor of the big picture. he has sorted out the macro-economy by borrowing the liberal democrats' idea for an independent bank of england   we welcome that move   and by laying fiscal foundations and introducing a code of fiscal stability."
1091,4/20/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"on smaller-scale economic policy, however, he is found wanting.  the budget continues to lock in the economic stability that the government have delivered by keeping public finances under control. we have taken tough and decisive action with a new framework for monetary policy by making the bank of england independent and setting up a new framework for the public finances based on tough rules."
1092,4/20/1999,Labour,labour,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche),"the excellent speech of my hon. following on from the points that have been made about setting exchange rates and interest rates, can the right hon. gentleman confirm that the official position of her majesty's opposition is that the independence of the bank of england will be abolished, as will the new deal?"
1093,4/29/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"what is the probability of those policies changing next week in the light of a new statement by the leader of the opposition or his deputy? we have opposed the policies that have been referred to today. that is our official position, and we think that the country would be better off without the minimum wage and without an independent central bank in its current shape."
1094,4/29/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Gordon Marsden,what a curious lot the opposition are. the present government have introduced policies that lock in long-term stability at macro level. that is why we introduced operational independence for the bank of england.
1095,4/29/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Gordon Marsden,"we cannot abolish the business cycle, but we can reduce its amplitude. redwood) could not tell us whether he would abolish the minimum wage and whether he agreed with the shadow chancellor that the conservatives would put it on hold. he could not say whether they would abandon the new deal or whether they would end the operational independence of the bank of england."
1096,4/29/1999,Labour,labour,"The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities (Mr. Andrew Smith)","he, too, omitted to mention the fall in long-term youth unemployment in his constituency in the past two years. the government made it clear that we would not play short-term party politics with interest rates. we have given independence to the monetary policy committee of the bank of england, and we will support decisions taken by the bank on interest rates."
1097,5/6/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,"it is largely because of that independence that we now have the lowest long-term interest rates for 40 years, which is good news for exporters and for the economy in general. friend is developing a very powerful argument. is not another stark contrast the fact that, on matters that the government thought were important   such as a windfall tax, an emergency budget and giving the bank of england independence   they rushed into taking action as soon as they got into office, whereas they took no such action on pensions, because they did not think that pensions were important?"
1098,5/11/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Collins,"in 18 years in opposition, the government were able to work out plans on some matters, whereas pensions did not seem to be sufficiently important for them to think about. there will be no return to stop-go, boom-and-bust policies. we have kept inflation low, we have made the bank of england independent, and we have set tough fiscal disciplines."
1099,5/13/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"all those disciplines are now yielding results in terms of both the inflation rate and the growth path of the economy, but we have still to have some answers from the opposition. they oppose bank of england independence. they oppose all the measures that we are taking that are to do with employment   the minimum wage, the working families tax credit and the new deal."
1100,5/13/1999,Labour,labour,Jacqui Smith,"will he spell out which of the government's policies he believes have contributed to creating that growth, and which future policies will ensure that it continues? will he also assure the house that he will not be thrown off by an opposition who seem to be unsure whether they believe that public spending is reckless or desirable, whether the bank of england should be independent, and whether they would raise or lower business taxes? we have had a wide-ranging debate."
1101,5/17/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Andrew Smith,"he did not mention the fact that we now have record levels of employment and, what is more, record levels of vacancies for this stage of the economic cycle. he referred to vacancies, however, and should accept that their number is not totally unrelated to the tough decisions that this government took in their early months in office   the fact that we made bank of england operations independent, got the public finances under control, invested wisely in public services and set about raising training and education standards and introducing initiatives such as the new deal. all those have helped to get record numbers into employment."
1102,5/17/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Andrew Smith,"gentleman said he supported. during the recess, the education and employment committee heard devastating evidence from the independent bank of england on the employment consequences of joining the euro. the deputy governor said that it would take hundreds of years to know whether joining was a good idea."
1103,6/10/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Nick St. Aubyn,"when can we have a debate on the real threat to jobs from joining the euro? what would be the effect on the british economy if bank of england independence were scrapped, interest rates were returned to the levels under the previous administration, and the Â£40 billion for schools and hospitals were also scrapped? would not those tory policies represent a significant threat to the well-being of everyone in the country if that lot were ever re-elected?"
1104,6/16/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"the wisdom of our economic policies has been criticised at every stage by the conservative party, which wants to reverse bank of england independence, reverse the new deal and reverse the national minimum wage. it also opposes the extra spending on schools and hospitals.  i shall deal first with the powers largely exercised under crown prerogative."
1105,6/22/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. David Davis,"i am agnostic about the virtues of european central bank independence union decision making. however, it strikes me as extraordinary that parliament has no say not only in the decisions, but in who makes them. of them were not subsidised at all."
1106,6/23/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"that is in addition to bank of england independence, which has produced the lowest interest rate for 30 years; the largest ever rise in child benefit; the minimum wage; 2 million families helped by the working families tax credit; and, this autumn, a f100 bonus for pensioners. all those measures have one thing in common: the tories would scrap them. i welcome the former chancellor to our proceedings, although he will again be surprised to see the strength with which conservative front-bench spokesmen are against the position that he holds on emu."
1107,6/24/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"i hope that he, too, will come to the view that it is a good thing that we made the bank of england independent, and i hope that he will try to persuade his colleagues that the conservative front-bench position of being completely against the independence of the bank of england threatens a return to stop-go in the economy. the strength with which the conservatives have opposed the independence of the bank of england makes it almost impossible for them, with any integrity, to change their position between now and the general election. with regard to the exchange rate, as the former chancellor will know, 80 per cent."
1108,6/25/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"gentleman suggested that the reduction in interest rates was somehow a tory legacy. does he accept that that is a product of the independence of the bank of england and that when that decision was made, long-term interest rates went down overnight? given what he said, can he confirm that, unlike many of his hon."
1109,6/25/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"friends, he is in favour of the independence of the bank of england? on the question of fudge, will the hon. gentleman clear up where he stands on the independence of the bank of england?"
1110,6/25/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Gareth R. Thomas,"he has written about the need for an independent bank of england. will he give us an unequivocal statement that he still supports the independence of the bank of england? while he is clearing up that issue, will he also tell us whether he intends to campaign within his party in favour of the abolition of the national minimum wage?"
1111,6/25/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Murphy,"they have introduced a whole raft of policy innovations to deliver economic stability. in week 1, the bank of england became independent. that was much criticised by the official opposition, but much welcomed by business and others outside the house."
1112,6/25/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Murphy,what is conservative party policy on the issue? is it to reverse the independence of the bank of england or to stay with the stable environment created by the correct decision taken in the first week or so of the labour government?  independence for the bank of england has helped us to deliver low inflation and provide an economic framework to guarantee long-term investment.
1113,6/25/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Murphy,"labour is the champion of long-term investment because we know that we must invest in our people and our infrastructure. gentleman has referred several times to the independence of the bank of england. there are independent central banks elsewhere in the world, but they are truly independent."
1114,6/25/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Butterfill,"there is a big difference between independent banks with an independent system for appointing their governors and the system introduced by the chancellor, whereby the governors of the bank of england are appointed by him. that must call into question, at least to some extent, their true independence. long-term interest rates are an expectation on the part of the financial markets of future inflation."
1115,6/25/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,the markets are saying that they accept the current structure of the bank of england as independent of political interference and believe that it will generate stable and low levels of inflation in the long term. that is precisely what the government and the country want. this government have taken the tough action needed to create the stable and supportive environment that business needs.
1116,6/25/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Wills," we have given the bank of england operational independence to set interest rates. friend announced, alongside operational independence for the bank of england, that a new regulator would be created with responsibility for supervising all aspects of the financial services industry. the bill gives the fsa the statutory basis and powers that it needs to be the world's leading regulator of financial services."
1117,6/28/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Loughton,"the market confidence objective is inextricably linked to it, but there is little elaboration in the bill.  we are told that there is the tripartite relationship between the treasury, the fsa and the bank of england which stems from the bank of england act 1998   which gave the monetary policy committee independence in 1997   but we know little about how the arrangement works. we are assured that there are monthly meetings between the three bodies, but i am not sure whether the minutes of those meetings are made available."
1118,7/5/1999,Labour,labour,Ms Hewitt, we engaged in a full and interesting debate on this subject in committee. clause 125 completes the separation between monetary policy and cash management   debt management operations   that we undertook when we gave the bank of england operational independence in regard to monetary policy. the new clause is simply and genuinely a technical consequence of the main provision that we introduced in the bill.
1119,7/6/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Cable,"i was surprised that the conservative spokesman quoted in defence the views of professor willem buiter, whose articles i have read. professor buiter is an independent-minded member of the monetary policy committee, and has gone out of his way to argue   as distinct from the governor of the bank of england   that britain should be a member of emu and, moreover, that it is likely to succeed. that is a different position from the one that the right hon."
1120,7/22/1999,Labour,labour,Ms Hewitt,"reduction in unemployment in his constituency. we took the decision to make the bank of england independent to secure economic stability and low interest rates. the conservatives have opposed independence for the bank of england, just as they have opposed all our other policies for growth and stability."
1121,7/22/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Bill Rammell,friend agree that the granting of operational independence to the bank of england has brought the greatest economic stability in this country in a generation? will she confirm that she will resist the demands from the conservative party to move away from operational independence? friend is right.
1122,7/22/1999,Labour,labour,Ms Hewitt,"we took the tough decision to give the bank of england operational independence. every month for the past two years, the conservative party has denigrated and opposed that decision. friend agree that the conservative party's muddled position on bank of england independence given yesterday   that the issue should be referred to a commission to look at the workings of the monetary policy committee   shows that, had the tories been in power, we would have had two years of muddle?"
1123,7/27/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"we would not have had the lowest short-term interest rates for 30 years and the lowest long-term interest rates for 40 years, inflation would have been out of control and the economy would have been in chaos. the shadow chancellor is not even at first base on those issues. i presume that he aspires one day to be chancellor of the exchequer, but he cannot even answer the most basic question about monetary policy: is he in favour or against independence for the bank of england?"
1124,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn,"we do not need a review; we simply need him to answer yes or no.  there should be well-understood rules. we have a new system of monetary policy making, at the heart of which is the independence of the bank of england and its open letter system, and an equivalent and equally important set of fiscal procedures that are legally enshrined in the code of fiscal stability."
1125,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn," we must also have transparency in policy making, with an open system of decision making in monetary policy through the publication of minutes, a voting system and full reporting to parliament. the minister says that those are the new rules of the game. will he confirm that those rules fail to satisfy the maastricht treaty in the degree of independence given to the bank of england?"
1126,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn,friend the shadow chancellor   maastricht man   because he is the man who signed the maastricht treaty.  giving operational independence to the bank of england for setting interest rates is at the heart of the new framework that we have established. before the house today is the bank of england's first annual report to be published under the new monetary policy framework.
1127,7/27/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Davies,"friend is no doubt aware, the report of the select committee on the treasury says that the activities of the monetary policy committee staved off recession. does it not follow that, had we not advocated the independence of the bank of england under the conservatives, we would not have staved off recession   a quarter of the world is in recession now   and would have returned to the tory years of unemployment, spending cuts and higher taxes? as i explained to the hon."
1128,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn,"short-term political considerations forced changes to the economy which, in the long and indeed the medium term, did not prove beneficial for the economy or for other people.  everyone now sees that bank of england independence is working   everyone, that is, with one exception. conservative members have never supported bank of england independence."
1129,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn," [interruption.] oh, some did. a last-minute conversion is better than no conversion at all. as i made clear in a speech when the bank of england bill was going through, i have been sympathetic to bank of england independence for many years."
1130,7/27/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"indeed, i was involved in the working up of a proposal for a measure of bank of england independence in the mid-1980s, when the labour party vigorously opposed any form of bank of england independence. it did not even have the courage to put it clearly in its manifesto before the people at the last election. gentleman is to keep his head down if he wants promotion in today's conservative party, because the policies that he advocates will not find favour."
1131,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn,the conservative party's position was to vote against the bank of england bill; it voted against bank of england independence. it has restated its opposition on countless occasions since then.  now they say that they are having second thoughts about it.
1132,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn," the truth is that the conservatives are at sixes and sevens on bank of england independence. they can see bank of england independence working, delivering the goods and providing the economic stability that our country needs, but they still yearn to scrap it. they hanker for the days when it was politicians who set interest rates   the days of the late 1980s and early 1990s when they decided to put up interest rates to 15 per cent."
1133,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn," today's conservative party has learned nothing from those past failures. making the bank of england independent has helped britain to steer a course for stability. the conservatives would put all that at risk by returning us to the era of stop go, which was so damaging to the long-term interests of the british economy."
1134,7/27/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Sheerman,"friend being a little unfair to the conservative opposition because at least there is some fancy footwork going on? does he not agree that they have realised what a terrible mistake they have made in opposing independence of the bank of england? they have realised that they must change their mind and have set up some committee, which will report that they should change their mind and let them off the hook."
1135,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn,"oh, the hon. gentleman does not continue to oppose bank of england independence. he had better confer with the right hon."
1136,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn,"as we have heard, there are many different positions among those on the conservative back benches. i hope that that review of the policy on bank of england independence continues for many months. i was going to call the hon."
1137,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn,"the conservatives' stated policy is to return us to the bad old days of stop go, boom bust. that is precisely what we have taken out of the equation by giving, rightly, operational independence to the bank of england. that is not a decision just for today or tomorrow."
1138,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn,"in debates on the past two finance bills alone, they have proposed to take billions of pounds from the self-same services that they now say that they support.  the truth is that conservative members are as much at sixes and sevens on public spending policy as they are on policy for bank of england independence. try as hard as they might, they simply cannot escape their past."
1139,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn," this debate throws into very sharp relief the key differences between the labour government and the conservative opposition. the government have made the bank of england independent, creating a platform of economic stability. the conservatives would remove that independence, and take britain back to the old days of boom and bust."
1140,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn,"at the next general election the british people will be faced with a clear choice between today's conservative party, which is the most extreme in living memory, and this new labour government who are working to create an enterprise economy and a fair society that benefits low and middle income britain alike. giving the bank of england operational independence as part of the new framework for economic stability was a bold and courageous move by the government. the report from the select committee on the treasury was published yesterday and is one of the documents relevant to this debate."
1141,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Giles Radice,"it shows that the move is paying off already.  the arguments for the bank of england's operational independence   for an independent monetary policy   were strongly supported by two former conservative chancellors, and by the hon. member for grantham and stamford (mr."
1142,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Giles Radice,"davies), my former colleague on the select committee. he will remember that the arguments for the change were that it would bring greater credibility, more transparency and accountability, greater stability and a better inflation record   after all, most countries with independent central banks have a better inflation record than those without.  the report concludes that it is probably too soon to reach a definitive judgment on the record of the monetary policy committee, because it takes 18 months to two years for the full impact of the committee's decisions to work through to inflation outcomes."
1143,7/27/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"tyrie). there is a need for greater independence for the bank of england, and i hope that the select committee on the treasury will continue to push for it.  i was disappointed by the speech of the right hon."
1144,7/27/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"member for wells mentioned the government's annual report, which was published yesterday, and which rightly referred to the government's success on inflation and interest rates.  by building on the independence that they gave to the bank of england, the government have achieved a good record on inflation and interest rates. risks remain on inflation, such as the possibility   receding and less strong than it was a few months ago   that the pound might collapse, thus importing inflation."
1145,7/27/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"the government, with the help of the monetary policy committee, have avoided recession, but as much by good fortune as good management, with some helpful developments in the international economy.  much of the success has been built on the independence of the bank of england, an idea borrowed from the liberal democrat manifesto. however, how can the bank's independence and accountability be improved?"
1146,7/27/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"allowing the bank to set the inflation target itself would be a strong move towards independence, and it would reassure markets of the bank's credibility.  as the government promote convergence and prepare, through the changeover plan, to move towards the single currency, they will be required to change the statutory framework for the independence of the bank of england, as the hon. member for guildford (mr."
1147,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Ms Keeble," i shall set out briefly what we have done. we provided independence for the bank of england and established the monetary policy committee, which has delivered the lowest interest rates for a generation. the tories opposed that."
1148,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr: Bill Rammell,"he should look at what the independent commentators have said about the government's management of the economy. they have a very impressive record, setting in place the framework for economic stability and granting operational independence to the bank of england, which established greater confidence for investors and the belief that decisions would be taken for sound economic reasons, not for short-term party political gain. the immediate benefit of that   longer-term interest rates   is there for all to see."
1149,7/27/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Love,member for wells (mr. heathcoat-amory) refused to comment on the independence of the bank of england two years on; perhaps the hon. gentleman will give us his view.
1150,7/27/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Blunt,"let me add that i was saying that we are enjoying relatively benign economic circumstances, which is probably why there is relative economic stability. personally, i consider it right for the bank of england to be independent   not least under a labour government, because labour does not believe that the markets can be trusted with the handling of monetary policy. it is probably as well, from the point of view of the united kingdom and for prosperity generally, that labour made the bank independent."
1151,7/27/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Blunt," there is a question mark over the make-up of the monetary policy committee, and the rules that underlie it. those who look at the rules relating to such matters as the three-year term will see just how independent the bank of england really is, and will see what powers will be left to the chancellor of the exchequer in extremis. in general, however, i support the bank's independence."
1152,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. David Kidney,"friend the member for north durham (mr. radice)   an excellent chairman of the select committee on the treasury, on which i serve   about the independence of the bank of england and the contribution of the monetary policy committee to our current climate of economic stability.  it could be said that the time for political argument about whether the bank's independence is a good idea is coming to an end as reality takes over."
1153,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Kidney,"i accept that stafford local education authority is a pilot for the national grid for learning, but it has made a reality of the grid, with all schools either connected, or about to be connected, to the internet, and it means more money for teachers pay.  on future development, the first thing that i hope to see   it is not in the government's gift   is the tories complete their u-turn on bank of england independence. all-party agreement on that would add to the credibility of monetary policy."
1154,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. John Cryer,"friend the chief secretary to the treasury, who dealt with them at length.  the european central bank represents, in its most refined and powerful form, a feature central to the neo-liberal economic catechism   the independence of central banks. two reasons are usually adduced to support that independence."
1155,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. John Cryer,"the second is that the long-term economic benefits that can be achieved by economists are a fair price to pay for the loss of democratic control.  the arguments put forward in support of the first-political   reason for central bank independence can be advanced for other areas of government policy. for example, health and social policies are notoriously complicated."
1156,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. John Cryer,"according to that argument, foreign policy decisions should have been handed over to technocrats who had the country's long-term interests at heart, and taken away from politicians and their short-term considerations.  the evidence for the second argument   that independent central banks deliver long-term economic benefits to their economies   is patchy, at best. even in connection with fighting inflation, the evidence is extremely thin, and the evidence for independent central banks meeting with success in fighting inflation in developing countries is non-existent."
1157,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. John Cryer,"their record is, if anything, worse than that of developing country central banks under government control. he is one of the few hon. members on the opposition benches who voluntarily raised the issue of bank of england independence, and the wonderful independent commission that the shadow chancellor has set up   under his own stewardship."
1158,7/27/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Christopher Leslie,"the shadow chancellor is to chair his own commission that will consider whether the conservatives should do a u-turn on their policy on bank of england independence. how ignominious, how humiliating for them! we have managed to steer ourselves through difficult international times by maintaining a careful course of stability, and by focusing on getting monetary policy and fiscal policy to work together in such a clever relationship."
1159,7/27/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Christopher Leslie, the monetary policy framework that we have put in place and the independence of the bank of england have been a success. i should be interested to hear from the hon. member for west dorset (mr.
1160,7/27/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Christopher Leslie,"letwin) his party's policy on the bank of england's independence. i know that there are many different views, but does he agree with, for example, the shadow chancellor who, only nine months ago, said, ""we would not have given up control of interest rates in the first place"", or with the right hon. the fact is that, as several hon."
1161,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt),"members pointed out this evening, the conservative party has persistently opposed the independence that we granted to the bank of england, and the creation of a successful monetary policy framework that is delivering the lowest long-term interest rates and the lowest mortgage rates for more than 30 years. the conservatives are opposed to that successful policy, and their spokesman has nothing whatever to say on the subject.  we know, and have known for some time, what the conservative party is now against."
1162,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Ms Hewitt,"it is against independence for the bank of england, the minimum wage, the working families tax credit and the new deal. now we want to know what the conservatives would cut. i understand that the hon."
1163,7/27/1999,Labour,labour,Ms Hewitt,"gentleman supports the independence of the bank of england and the new monetary policy framework. i am surprised that he did not intervene to congratulate us on implementing a policy that is supported by him, but opposed by his front bench. all of that would be at risk if the conservatives' policies were pursued."
1164,10/20/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"they would scrap the working families tax credit, scrap the new deal and scrap bank of england independence.  although they tell us that they want to cut social spending, i can tell the house that, in the past few weeks, they have tabled amendments to the social security legislation for an extra Â£3 billion of spending. indeed, britain was set to repeat the old, familiar cycle of boom and bust."
1165,11/9/1999,Labour,labour,The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gordon Brown),"since then, we have created and rigorously adhered to a new framework of modern economic management: a clearly defined inflation target and clear fiscal rules backed up by legislation for an independent bank of england and a regime of fiscal stability.  over the past year, inflation has remained at or around our target.  i listened to what the shadow chancellor said about what now passes for a conservative economic policy."
1166,11/9/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"the conservatives opposed bank of england independence and put at risk stability. they opposed the necessary interest rate rises and put at risk inflation. i know that the former chancellor of the exchequer cannot be seen to agree with me   at least, not in the house in commons."
1167,11/9/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"he mentioned the first thing the labour government did, but the first thing we did was make the bank of england independent. it is interesting that the right hon. the working families tax credit helps low-income families, but is opposed by the tory party."
1168,11/10/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"bank of england independence gives stability in the economy, but it is opposed by the tory party. if any of those points is unfair, when the leader of the opposition gets up, he can tell us. everyone   whether in the country, the town or city   benefits from policies such as the new deal and the working families tax credit."
1169,11/10/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,people benefit from bank of england independence for a more stable economy and from the rise in child benefit. the conservative party would scrap all those policies. what assessment he has made of the effect on his policy of bank of england independence of entry to the eurozone.
1170,11/11/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. John Bercow, [96991] what assessment he has made of the impact of his policy of independence of the bank of england.  [96996]
1171,11/11/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith,"what is equally clear is that there are two routes to stability. of course, were we to join the euro, the bank of england would have to be brought into conformity with the treaties, but there are two routes to stability: the independent bank of england that we have established, or a european central bank arrangement. there is no route to stability on offer from the conservative party, under which we would be back to boom and bust."
1172,11/11/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith,"one of the strong advantages of the monetary policy committee is that a combination of voices with different experience makes that important judgment. ultimately, however, we judge the bank of england's operational independence and the monetary policy committee's decisions on what they deliver. what they have delivered is low and stable inflation, which has hit the target that they have been set."
1173,11/11/1999,Labour,labour,Miss Johnson,"gentleman will not even tell us whether he supports one of the key measures to ensure that we have that stability in the british economy   the independence of the bank of england. i notice that so far the right hon. gentleman has not mentioned the economy, and he has been reluctant to defend the previous government's record."
1174,11/17/1999,Labour,labour,Maria Eagle,"what is his position on the independence of the bank of england? is he in favour of it or not? members: ""hear, hear.""] thank you."
1175,11/17/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister," the new stability was delivered only by bank of england independence and by new borrowing and spending rules. given that the leader of the opposition has had two and a half years to work out his policy on bank of england independence, i presume that it is present conservative policy. the present shadow chancellor    [hon."
1176,11/17/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister," the leader of the opposition said:
 they have given up control of interest rates when they should have kept hold of them.  more recently, he accused us of ""dangerous arrogance"" in granting independence for the bank of england. is conservative policy to reverse bank of england independence?"
1177,11/17/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"we can see why there were so many jokes in the right hon. corporation tax   not quite the sort of thing that democratic socialists favour, except that we realise that there are pressures in the era of global competition in capital markets. we would not necessarily have wanted to be associated with measures such as the independence of the bank of england and the central european bank reforms."
1178,11/17/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Barnes," the queen's speech will produce much legislation of which we can be proud. that will involve, and already has involved, taking difficult decisions.  we gave independence to the bank of england over interest rates."
1179,11/19/1999,Labour,labour,The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Stephen Byers),"that was criticised by some, including the hon. lady's views on the matter. does she believe that the bank of england should no longer have the independence to establish interest rates?"
1180,11/19/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,"i know that her personal view is that it should not. the conservatives are, more than ever, a single-issue group, obsessed with europe and little else, looking back to the past and scared of the future. the conservative party resists change: it says no to the new deal, the working families tax credit, the national minimum wage, independence of the bank of england, family friendly employment policies and the working time provisions."
1181,11/19/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers," the queen's speech outlines the programme of a forward-looking government, in the mainstream of british politics, which is prepared to modernise and reform, to embrace the new and leave behind the old way of operating, and to bring together enterprise and fairness in the belief that wealth creation and social justice are two sides of the same coin. for the benefit of the secretary of state for trade and industry, i should say that my right hon. friend the shadow chancellor is currently taking evidence from a wide range of interested parties on bank of england independence."
1182,11/19/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mrs. Browning,"when the evidence has been considered, we shall announce our policy in the customary way.  none the less, there is a consensus about good practice and the kind of things that the government ought to do to help the economy maximise its potential. one of those is to provide a framework for financial stability, and we give the government credit for their advances in that area, notably monetary stability, the independence of the bank of england and low inflation."
1183,11/19/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Dr. Vincent Cable,"those are all positive achievements. i am also pleased that the debate today combines the concerns of trade and industry and of social security.  the first condition for economic success and therefore social investment is economic stability, which has been established already through the independence given to the bank of england."
1184,11/19/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"however, the comments of the hon. member for tiverton and honiton (mrs. browning) emphasised how unclear is the opposition's attitude to the bank of england's independence."
1185,11/19/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"the common-sense revolution now appears to mean no more than preserving the right to change one's mind about matters. member for tiverton and honiton or her party seriously on that or many other issues, including post office privatisation. the general public will not understand the position of the conservative party, although people will know that the government's decision to make the bank of england independent was the first step towards providing the economic stability that, among other things, has given employment to an extra 700,000 people."
1186,11/19/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"it now pays to work, thanks to the working families tax credit and the minimum wage. that was outrageous, and almost as bad as the case of rai1track, which was sold for Â£1.9 billion and is now worth Â£8 billion. it is not the hopeless misjudgments of the leader of the opposition over the conservative party that should worry people; it is his misjudgment over bank of england independence, scrapping the working families tax credit and the new deal, which has halved youth unemployment, and starting an illegal trade war with the rest of europe that would have put thousands of jobs at risk."
1187,11/24/1999,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"as leader of the opposition he may be a joke, but as prime minister he would be a disaster. they are neither incidental nor accidental, and cannot be dismissed as unimportant to economic policy. the bank of england's independence is the foundation of monetary and fiscal policy; the new deal is the foundation of employment policy; the minimum wage is the foundation of our policy to make work pay and the working families tax credit is the foundation of our policy for families."
1188,11/24/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"does the country not now deserve to know whether the opposition support   in principle, not in detail   the minimum wage, the working families tax credit, bank of england independence and the new deal? if, after two and a half years, opposition members cannot answer those questions, they have absolutely no credibility on the economy. gentleman allow me to put a question to him?"
1189,11/24/1999,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"if he is so very convinced of the desirability of an independent bank of england why, when he set up the new arrangements shortly after the election, did he take care to keep the power to override the monetary policy committee and the governor of the bank of england if he thought it necessary in a national crisis? in almost every arrangement that governs the independence of central banks, an override is allowed for exceptional circumstances. perhaps the shadow chancellor can tell us whether the conservative party wants to keep the bank of england independent but with no override."
1190,11/24/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown," i have asked five serious questions about the conservative party's economic policy, and i have quoted the nott committee's doubts about the shadow chancellor's policies. he wants people to believe that it would be best for britain if we scrapped the new deal and the working families tax credit. the shadow chancellor wants us to scrap bank of england independence."
1191,11/24/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"the conservatives are incapable of answering questions on the economy, and they have no credibility.  our domestic policy is built on five foundations   stability, employment and no return to the unemployment that we saw under the conservatives, help and not harm for working families, investing billions more in the public services rather than privatising parts of them and support for engagement in europe against isolation in europe. we have made the bank of england independent   "
1192,11/24/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"i hope that you are enjoying the debate, mr.  we made the bank of england independent, and we ensured that interest rate decisions are taken in the long-term interests of the economy, and not for short-term political considerations. we now have a sound and credible platform of stability, low inflation, and low long-term interest rates."
1193,11/24/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"on the main issues of health, education and pensions, we have done more than any liberal ever dreamed of doing.  we have announced the new interdepartmental reviews of the spending round, which is part of our policy for fiscal and monetary stability, the foundation of which is the independence of the bank of england. that is the first divide between ourselves and our opponents."
1194,11/24/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"we support the independence of the bank of england, and monetary and fiscal stability under the clear rules that we have drawn up; we have had no answers from the opposition.  the second difference is that we support constructive action in europe, whereas the conservatives are unprepared to do so; indeed, they would leave us isolated. the first is the golden rule, a sensible approach to public spending and balancing the economy, for which we argued before the general election."
1195,11/24/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Matthew Taylor,"the second is independence for the bank of england, for which we argued and which the chancellor opposed before the general election. the third important element is the success of the american economy, the present growth within the other european countries and the quite remarkable bounce back of the asian economies and the signs of growth in japan. i propose to do that as well."
1196,11/24/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Tyler," liberal democrat members were pleased when the government poached our policy on the independence of the bank of england. the chancellor opposed that central economic policy when in opposition, yet it was taken up as part of the new government's policy.  i come to the progress of our monetary policy."
1197,11/24/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr.Leslie,"the monetary policy committee and the independence of the bank of england have enabled us to create a safer and more transparent way of setting interest rates that is free from the political dogma and the whims of the partisan conservative party. in october 1998, the right hon. maude), the shadow chancellor, said:
 we would not have given up control of interest rates in the first place."
1198,11/24/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr.Leslie," therefore, we can all assume that, should the prospect of the conservatives returning to government ever materialise   on the form that has been apparent this week, that is a distant prospect   they would reverse the bank of england's independence. in the absence of any other policy from them, we wait to hear whether that is so. the reason the uk has experienced only a modest slowdown in growth rather than another full-blown recession is the outstanding control over inflation""."
1199,11/24/1999,Labour,labour,Ms Ruth Kelly," he went on to say that the most important factor was the independence of the bank of england   a clear strategic success in policy making.  the success in controlling inflation can be seen not only in the headline inflation rate, but in people's expectations for inflation over the coming years. last year, he accused the chancellor of fantasy forecasting and peter pan economics   now we know which party lives in never-never land."
1200,11/24/1999,Labour,labour,Ms Ruth Kelly," the conservative party could not accept bank of england independence and the tough new fiscal rules. it could not accept that those policies would create the economic stability that now exists. we still do not know whether it would keep or abolish bank of england independence, the tough new fiscal rules, the minimum wage or the working families tax credit."
1201,11/24/1999,Labour,labour,Ms Ruth Kelly,"from time to time, we are accused of introducing stealth taxes to rectify the macro-economic disaster that the tories bequeathed us, but the conservatives have stealth policies. friend makes an excellent point. if we abolished bank of england independence and the tough new fiscal rules, we would return to the boom-and-bust policies of 18 years of tory rule."
1202,11/24/1999,Labour,labour,Ms Kelly,"no one in this country wants that. we have made a start by moving towards enterprise and fairness. the government have rejected the boom and bust of the conservative party, taken the politics out of setting interest rates by giving independence to the bank of england, cut the deficit and put the public finances back into good shape."
1203,11/24/1999,Labour,labour,Ms Kelly,"we are taking strides towards a full-employment economy, making work pay and investing in our people and their ideas. however, they did not hand over control to the european commission. they handed it over to an independent central bank, because their experience, which on the whole had been successful, showed that independent central banks work."
1204,12/1/1999,Conservative,conservative,Raymond Whitney," such a climate is relatively new   it is certainly new to some of my hon. it depends on the subsequent general election and the convening of members here as a free parliament. the decisions of those voters in those polling booths will effectively be taken away if we have a single currency and a central bank: in that event, decisions will be made by people who are both unaccountable and independent."
1205,12/1/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Cash,"i am against the single currency for that reason. since april 1997? would he put that down solely to the stability brought about by giving the bank of england independence, or would he, like me, agree that positive contributions have also been made by the national minimum wage, the working families tax credit, the new deal for the unemployed and the Â£40 billion extra money to be spent on our schools and hospitals?"
1206,12/21/1999,Labour,labour,The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Andrew Smith),"i beg to move,
 that this house welcomes the action taken by this government to build a platform of stability for the british economy, in contrast to the boom and bust of the past; welcomes the new monetary policy framework put in place by this government, which is delivering stability and steady growth; notes that the conservative party opposes bank of england independence; welcomes the new public spending framework which is delivering an additional Â£40 billion for health and education; notes that the conservative party is opposed to this extra investment; welcomes the fact that this government is doubling public sector net investment after so many years of neglect; welcomes this government's programme of reform in the public services and thanks public and voluntary sector workers for their contribution to delivering strong public services for all.  it will not have escaped your attention, madam speaker, that despite the fact that the opposition were keen to have this debate in government time, only four conservative back benchers have turned up. that means that the peak under this government is the same as the trough under the previous government."
1207,12/21/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"does not that underline the fact that we have got rid of boom-and-bust economics, partly through giving independence to the bank of england, and partly through the prudence of the treasury team? friend noted, we took courageous steps: we put in place a new, modern monetary policy framework and we made the bank of england operationally independent, thus ensuring that decisions on interest rates are taken in the best long-term interests of the economy, not for short-term political reasons. we also set a clearly defined and symmetrical inflation target."
1208,12/21/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith, i remind the house that the conservative party remains opposed to the government's monetary policy framework and bank of england independence. the conservatives threaten to take britain back to the bad old days of tory boom and bust. friend the member for horsham (mr.
1209,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Stephen Dorrell,"maude), the shadow chancellor, has set up a commission    i anticipate   to move the conservative party's position in the direction of an independent status for the bank of england. i am glad that that is no longer regarded as the focus for a short-term debate in the house of commons.  under the past two and a half years of the labour government, we have seen that there was a real alternative   one of steady and sustainable economic growth, low inflation, high employment rates and proper investment in our public services."
1210,12/21/1999,Labour,labour,Mr. Stinchcombe,"we were told that we had copied the conservatives' policies, but the conservatives did not back the new deal, the minimum wage or the independence of the bank of england. indeed, they set their face stonily against every one of the prudent policies that have changed their record of economic failure into our record of economic success. i hope that the chief secretary will relay to the chancellor the fact that the liberal democrats are delighted that he has taken much of the advice we have given him."
1211,12/21/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Davey,"for example, he gave independence to the bank of england, which was in the liberal democrat manifesto but not in labour's, and that was the most significant change in economic policy in this parliament. i am disappointed that the hon. gentleman feels that giving independence to the bank of england was a mistake, because i thought that the conservatives were coming round to that policy."
1212,12/21/1999,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Davey," the good news is that the chancellor is apparently reconsidering some other liberal democrat policies on public expenditure. gentleman to give way. i suggest that there is another restraint besides political judgment   that is, the response of the independent bank of england and the monetary policy committee to any tax cut or increase in public spending."
1213,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"those are forms of regulation and direction from the centre which i am not convinced will do the job. they stuck to the spending promise, more or less, but they broke the tax promise   the subject of several recent exchanges in the house. on monetary policy, they decided to become more catholic than the pope by making the bank of england independent and handing it the policy."
1214,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie," during the past year and a bit, there has been some slippage from what the public thought would occur. there is a strong argument to suggest that greater liberalisation of capital markets and the introduction of many new financial instruments will have that effect.  on the bank of england's independence, much more thought must be given to the increase in weight and importance of fiscal policy that the granting of independence on monetary policy triggers."
1215,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"again, much greater clarity on the meaning of the published numbers is required if we are to build market confidence. while the hon. gentleman is on the subject of the bank of england, will he give his view on whether it should remain independent in the future?"
1216,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"since the mid-1980s, i have held the view that bank of england independence has many advantages. i held that view when i was in the treasury and i made my view known publicly as soon as i left the treasury. i also made my views known when i spoke in the house on the debates on the bank of england act 1998."
1217,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"however, i do not think that the way the bank of england has been made independent is adequate. further reforms are clearly needed. several other changes are also required before the bank's reform is adequate."
1218,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie," the bank of england's independence has not been tested. it will be tested only when we have a recession or the next downturn, which according to ministers will never come. i do not think that the government have given any thought to that; i have not seen anything on it in the public domain."
1219,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"we may have created an independent central bank at just the time when central banks are becoming rather less relevant.  i wish to discuss one other subject and then i promise to sit down. in real terms, that is a lot of money."
1220,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Loughton," the independence of the bank of england is another key plank of the government's self-congratulatory motion, which praises the new monetary policy framework that is supposedly delivering stability and steady growth. the chief secretary could not resist the poke at the idea that the conservative party opposes independence for the bank of england, but i am not sure that it is true. it takes no account of the establishment by the conservative treasury team of a high-level monetary policy commission to examine bank of england independence, and to determine how real independence could work."
1221,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Loughton," i agree with my hon. making the mpc independent is not something that should be rushed into within two days of coming to power   especially when such a full-scale constitutional change had not been mentioned before.  there is great merit in the notion of an independent bank of england, but the mpc must have no chance of exerting political influence."
1222,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Loughton,"certainly, the terms of office of its members must resemble much more closely those applying in the bundesbank in germany and in the federal reserve bank in the united states. if volatility of financial markets is a constraint on the setting of interest rates, the mpc has clearly given it little weight.  we should have a proper debate on this matter, and not simply repeat unsubstantiated and vague mantras about who does or does not oppose bank of england independence."
1223,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Loughton,"we want to determine the extent of the bank's independence, and to decide whether giving it full independence would permit it to operate more effectively, as many conservative members would like. gentleman was talking about the volatility of interest rates and about whether the monetary policy committee of an independent bank of england could reduce that volatility. i share his concern, and i asked the governor of the bank of england that very question in the select committee."
1224,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. St. Aubyn,"an imaginative response from government could sustain growth, but judging by the actions of this government, who time and again have attacked savings through their tax increases rather than supporting them, i very much doubt whether we are in the hands of people who know which way to push the tiller.  we have heard a great deal of talk about the independence of the bank of england. as a member of the standing committee that considered the bank of england bill, i recall we were clear in our view that the government had neither delivered bank of england independence nor fulfilled the maastricht criteria."
1225,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. St. Aubyn,"they have offered the bank of england pseudo-independence, not real independence.  what is independent and what is long-term about a situation in which the average tenure of any member of the monetary policy committee is only 18 months? members are appointed on a phased basis for three years, so at any moment their average term of tenure is only 18 months."
1226,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. St. Aubyn,"we need members of any monetary policy committee to have a far longer term of tenure if we are to have a genuinely independent bank of england. without that, all the government's claims are spurious. clarke)   the former chancellor   to the lords select committee on the monetary policy committee of the bank of england."
1227,12/21/1999,Labour,labour,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms),"he said that he was in favour of independence for central banks and even said:
 i have always been in favour in principle of an independent central bank and i would have pressed it further if i thought there was the slightest chance of persuading my colleagues in the last government ¦that we should do that.  if the opposition have now changed their mind, we would welcome that. a few facts are needed."
1228,12/21/1999,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"when the idea of independence for the bank of england first came to public notice in 1989, after nigel lawson's resignation, the labour opposition vigorously opposed it and continued to do so up to the last general election. even during the election, the labour party said that some time would need to elapse before it would introduce the policy. that this house welcomes the action taken by this government to build a platform of stability for the british economy, in contrast to the boom and bust of the past; welcomes the new monetary policy framework put in place by this government, which is delivering stability and steady growth; notes that the conservative party opposes bank of england independence; welcomes the new public spending framework which is delivering an additional Â£40 billion for health and education; notes that the conservative party is opposed to this extra investment; welcomes the fact that this government is doubling public sector net investment after so many years of neglect; welcomes this government's programme of reform in the public services and thanks public and voluntary sector workers for their contribution to delivering strong public services for all."
1229,12/21/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"mr. in 1991 alone, some 75,000 homes were repossessed. since then financial stability in the marketplace, which is due partly to the bank of england's independence and partly to prudent housekeeping, has enabled the housing market largely to recover, and it is in good shape."
1230,12/21/1999,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies," that recovery, however, hides the fact that many thousands of people who have already faced a repossession in the past now face the haunting prospect of further debt recovery, up to 12 years after their home was repossessed. we have reduced small business tax, but, most important, we have produced stability in economic management after the boom and bust of the conservative years, and there are 800,000 more jobs in the economy since this government came to power. we have also introduced a minimum wage, a working families tax credit and bank of england independence."
1231,2/2/2000,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,the conservative party would scrap every single one of those measures.  i want to be entirely open to see whether we can get some openness from the chancellor. the next conservative government will respect the independence of the bank of england and will legislate to enhance that independence and increase accountability to parliament.
1232,2/3/2000,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Portillo,"the next conservative government will not repeal the national minimum wage. although i have been a member of the house for a only short time, it is clear that these events are almost unprecedented. i have served on a number of finance bill committees, as well as on the committees that brought independence to the bank of england and set up the greater london authority."
1233,2/29/2000,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"the liberal democrats often found common cause with the government   with whom we voted fairly often against amendments tabled by the conservatives   but that has not occurred on this occasion because the issues to which the bill gives rise go above party politics: as many members of the committee said, they are constitutionally important, so taking a party line and playing party politics is not appropriate. gentleman said, when they recognise that, they will act accordingly to uphold parliament's powers and rights in relation to government accounts. as we argued in the standing committee that established the independence of the bank of england, the great advantage of an independent body is that its moves are transparent and public."
1234,2/29/2000,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Davey,"through that transparency and openness, accountability is improved. as i said earlier, the hon. gentleman and his colleagues rightly gave the bank of england independence to set interest rates."
1235,2/29/2000,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Davey,"he supported that. that step improved accountability for monetary policy because it set a clear, publicly set goal for the independent bank of england to undertake monetary operations on a daily basis and to try to hit the inflation target.  the monetary policy committee's actions are recorded in minutes."
1236,2/29/2000,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Davey,"to my knowledge, there has never been a debate in the house about the directions that the treasury gives departments. there is a close analogy between the independence of the bank of england in setting interest rates and the subject of our debate. the government acknowledged the impossible conflict of interest that arises when governments fix interest rates, and weighed the short-term advantage of elections against the long-term advantage."
1237,2/29/2000,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"there is an override clause in the bank of england act 1998, for example. i am not sure whether it is a good idea, but no one is suggesting now, after some years of practice, that the bank of england has not been able to exercise a measure of independence. perhaps it should be given more independence."
1238,2/29/2000,Labour,labour,Miss Johnson,"friends referred to the independence of the bank of england and to the fact that the monetary policy committee still operated under guidelines, and pointed out that opposition members could cite no parallels in their proposals.  in the ""foreword to accounting standards"", the accounting standards board acknowledges that prescription of accounting requirements for the public sector in the uk is a matter for the government. our first priority, and our continuing commitment, is to deliver and lock in a platform of economic stability, leaving behind the boom and bust of past years."
1239,3/1/2000,Labour,labour,Dawn Primarolo,"our new, modern, monetary policy framework, with an independent bank of england, is ensuring that interest rate decisions are taken in the best long-term interest of the economy, not for short-term political reasons.  our modern fiscal and public spending framework, based on two clear fiscal rules   the golden rule that we balance the current budget over the cycle, and the sustainable investment rule that, as we borrow only for investment, debt is held to a prudent and sustainable level   is ensuring that public finances are on a sustainable long-term footing.  how have we achieved that progress?"
1240,3/1/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Rammell,"most important, we have achieved it through sound economic management   by removing the budget deficit, not borrowing more than we could afford over the economic cycle, granting operational independence to the bank of england and introducing transparency and openness to the operation of our public finances. that was crucial: without it, we could not gain the trust and confidence of the business community and investors that we need if we are to secure the economic growth that, over the longer term, represents the only sure-fire way in which we can obtain the extra investment in public services that we need. it is difficult to remember exactly what the conservative party was trying to achieve during its filibuster last night."
1241,3/1/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Rammell,"it is undoubtedly true, however, that our overall management of the economy   involving the operational independence of the bank of england, and the release of the minutes of the central committee   is introducing a degree of openness and transparency. that creates confidence, which means that investors and businesses have the confidence to invest and which, over the longer term, will generate the economic growth that we need. that is because, under the present government, with the economic stability that we have been able to create, small businesses can be formed and can plan ahead with confidence."
1242,3/8/2000,Labour,labour,The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Stephen Byers)," that is why, on taking office, we took immediate action to provide independence to the bank of england and to ensure that we did not repeat the cycle of boom and bust about which the hon. lady has kindly reminded the house. gentleman has been a powerful advocate in the house for a particular position on europe."
1243,3/8/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Byers,"giving the bank of england independence over the setting of the exchange rate in 1997 and getting public finances under control for the first time have laid the foundations for the economic stability that we are seeing.  i know that i will never convince the hon. at their peak, interest rates were 15 per cent., and they were in double figures for four of the conservative party's 18 years in office."
1244,3/8/2000,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Brian Cotter," liberal democrats were pleased when the government gave the bank of england independence as a way forward for the economy, a policy which we had advocated for many years. it is happened because of the measures that the government have taken. granting the bank of england operational independence on the management of monetary policy made a direct contribution towards the success with inflation, as has the principle of using inflation targeting."
1245,3/21/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Plaskitt,"the sound fiscal stance that the government have taken has also contributed directly to our impressive inflation record. friend the chancellor has ensured that that is all locked in, and he is right to have done so, as it will help us to continue to deliver comparatively low interest rates.  it is worth underlining the benefits that have accrued from granting the bank of england operational independence."
1246,3/21/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Plaskitt,"since that independence was granted, to control the cycle of the economy, interest rates have had to move in a band of 225 basis points   between a low of 5 per cent. friend think it strange that the opposition now say that they will more than match the amount of money that we will put into health, yet have consistently voted against all the economic measures   the new deal, independence for the bank of england, the end of boom and bust and making work pay   that have enabled us to get 800,000 people back into work and to have the wealth to put the money in now? i agree, in terms of the newest dot.coms."
1247,3/22/2000,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Taylor,"the chancellor must recognise that interest rates will have to converge, and that brings me to the real problem   fortunately, the opposition do not have to face it now   that there will be more active adjustments to the fiscal balance.  the government do not control monetary policy and interest rates   they are set by an independent bank of england and i approve of that. however, the chancellor has to take that into account and give signals to the monetary policy committee that if the economy does not perform as he expects, he will need to make upward as well as downward adjustments in taxation or spending or vary the savings ratio."
1248,3/22/2000,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies," during this parliament, the government have introduced measures to get more people back to work   for example, the new deal, which the opposition voted against. we made the bank of england independent, to provide macro-economic stability and to promote investment and employment, but that, too, was opposed by the opposition; and we have introduced the working families tax credit to make work pay. every measure that we have introduced to provide the economic platform needed to fund good investment in health and education for the future has been opposed by the party of boom and bust, economic irresponsibility and social division."
1249,3/27/2000,Labour,labour,The Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Alistair Darling)," we have strong public finances because we took tough decisions during the first two years of this parliament. we cut the huge debts that we inherited and we gave the bank of england independence, something that was opposed by the conservatives at the time. our public finances are strong."
1250,3/27/2000,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"portillo), the shadow chancellor, who with his first-class honours degree in modern history, albeit from cambridge, will understand them. apropos the volte face on our attitude to an independent central bank and the monetary policy committee, i do not have time to develop my theme as i would like. however, i remind my right hon."
1251,3/27/2000,Conservative,conservative,Peter Tapsell,"friend that when pope pius ix, having lost his temporal constituency, hit back by announcing the dogma of papal infallibility in 1870, the great roman catholic historian, lord acton, said:
 i have no intention of changing my religion because the pope has changed his.  that is exactly my attitude on an independent central bank. i am pleased to speak in support of the finance bill and against the amendments tabled by the liberal democrats and by the conservative party."
1252,4/17/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Roger Casale.," step by step, the government are constructing a platform of economic stability. the platform is an effective metaphor: it has sound and solid foundations, which are based on the independence of the bank of england and the new fiscal rules. the bill will rightly lock the new stability into place."
1253,4/17/2000,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"clarke) were ridiculous? he said that there would be no independence for the bank of england, interest rates would be lowered unilaterally and inflation would rip. perhaps he should be known as the chancellor ripper."
1254,4/17/2000,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Tyrie,"the chancellor has taken risks, partly for electoral purposes. he is fuelling the beginnings of a political cycle with his fiscal policy, and in that sense he is undermining the good work that he did when he tried to dissociate politics from the business cycle by making the bank of england independent. i shall be brief."
1255,5/16/2000,Labour,labour,The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Stephen Byers),"i beg to move, to leave out from ""house"" to the end of the question, and to add instead thereof: 
 recognises that industry does not want a return of the boom and bust policies of the previous government, with interest rates of 15 per cent, inflation above 10 per cent and soaring budget deficits; welcomes the government's decisive action in taking politics out of interest rate decisions; notes that employment is currently 880,000 higher than it was when the government came into office, and that long-term interest rates over the past year have been at their lowest for 35 years; welcomes the measures that the government has taken to encourage enterprise, investment and innovation which particularly help manufacturing businesses; welcomes the government's view that where firms are in difficulty the government has a role in helping people through change as opposed to the previous government's laissez-faire approach; and condemns the opposition for its record in government, when manufacturing employment declined by 2Â¾ million$1"" the government fully recognise the challenges that manufacturing faces in a global economy. one of the ways in which we can assist manufacturing to meet those challenges is to provide the economic stability that we now have in the united kingdom, not because of some legacy from the conservative government, but because of the steps that we took on coming to office in the first few days after 1 may 1997, giving the bank of england independence over interest rates to ensure that we did not play politics with interest rates, which certain right hon. members opposite may well have done during their time as chancellor of the exchequer."
1256,5/17/2000,Labour,labour,The Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce (Ms Patricia Hewitt),"that holds us back.  our first task was to secure economic stability and our first decision was to take the politics out of interest rates by giving the bank of england independence to set them. as a result, we have not only got inflation down and kept it down, but we have the lowest long-term   and, indeed, short-term   interest rates that we have had for a long time, with no prospect in this or, i think, the next economic cycle of returning to the appalling situation that we had under the previous government, when interest rates were above 10 per cent."
1257,5/17/2000,Labour,labour,The Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce (Ms Patricia Hewitt),"gentleman expressed his view and that of a large part of the conservative party about the euro, but one reason for our commitment in principle to joining a successful single currency if the economic conditions are met is that it would eliminate the exchange rate instability that has been so damaging and that has created such difficult conditions for manufacturing industry and other exporters. we are the party that introduced independence for the bank of england. we introduced the national minimum wage, the new deal and the working families tax credit."
1258,5/18/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith,"it is right that business has the confidence and the certainty to plan for the future, and it can do that with the platform of stability that we have created. we took the tough decisions on making the bank of england independent and on imposing a fiscal and monetary framework that provides stability. we have avoided the penal levels of interest rates from which manufacturing industry suffered under the conservatives and that saw manufacturing output down by 18 per cent."
1259,6/7/2000,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Kennedy,"although we join him in rightly criticising the boom-and-bust days that preceded this government, it is worth placing on the record the fact that, although he and his ministerial colleagues are occasionally   indeed, regularly   somewhat dismissive of our approach to economics, the central plank of the government's economic strategy, which has created the opportunities to do so many things, was in our manifesto but not in labour's. i am referring to operational independence for the bank of england. if one thought that it was simply a question of economic management, there would be little justification for a referendum."
1260,6/15/2000,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Campbell,"if one goes back to the period immediately after the last general election, the independence of the bank of england became a matter of economic management   with profound consequences, it must be said   but i do not remember any great pressure at that stage from those who form the official opposition for a referendum on that topic. the fact that it is now agreed   i think on both sides of the house   that there should be a referendum is an acknowledgement that entry into the currency has constitutional implications. real take-home pay is up by about 8 per cent., and when spending on areas that we want to spend money on, such as children and pensions, is taken out, welfare spending is falling for the first time in decades."
1261,7/13/2000,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister (Mr. Tony Blair),"but none of that has come without serious, grown-up choices   bank of england independence, taking the politics out of people's mortgages, and tough action to clear the deficit. i know that some of those decisions, such as the rises in fuel duty, were unpopular, but they were necessary. under the amendment,
 the treasury shall consult a group of persons who appear to the treasury to be appropriate to advise on financial reporting principles and standards."
1262,7/24/2000,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Letwin," i hope that the economic secretary will tell us that she will so arrange matters that those who ""appear ¦to be appropriate"" are renowned for their independence as well as their skill, and that she will seek, over time, to adjust the composition of the frab so that its independence is enhanced, in the same admirable way as, we hope, the monetary policy committee of the bank of england will become increasingly and evidently independent.  that is obviously important and coheres with the aspirations that the economic secretary has just enunciated. member for kensington and chelsea (mr."
1263,10/25/2000,Labour,labour,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms),"portillo), the shadow chancellor, yesterday told a house of lords select committee that he would scrap the independence of the bank of england in setting interest rates if he thought that it was being incompetent. frankly, when one compares what happened when the shadow chancellor was chief secretary to the treasury with the record over the past three and a half years of the monetary policy committee that this government established, there is little doubt about whose judgment most people would trust.  let me deal first with the forecasts for the economy."
1264,11/8/2000,Labour,labour,The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gordon Brown),"since 1997, our first and most fundamental choice has been   through bank of england independence, tough controls on public spending and difficult decisions on tax   to build economic stability. there were those in the house who predicted that our policies would bring recession.  the shadow chancellor told us that he would have tax cuts instead of investment, but the neglect of investment produced the problems in our supply side that meant that we could not sustain a consumer boom because there had been no investment during the 1980s."
1265,11/8/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"he has no inflation target   not even our symmetrical inflation target   and he even doubts whether he would keep the bank of england independent if, as he put it, he could judge it to be incompetent. most people have that view of him and his economic policies. there was also a neglect of investment in the supply side, so that, as the economy grew, we could not sustain the growth that we wanted."
1266,11/8/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown," equally, the former chancellor, as a supporter of independence of the bank of england, knows that the lack of a tough and tight monetary policy that is absolutely explicit about where we are trying to go is another recipe for a return to the situation that we had in the 1980s.  i believe that, on those three matters, the former chancellor and i would share common ground   if it were not for the fact that he also thinks he is preparing for a general election. gentleman supported the independence of the bank of england long before opposition front-bench spokesmen even considered doing so."
1267,11/8/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"i hope that he, like the former chancellor, the right hon. gentleman supports the independence of the bank of england: he should also support the government's fiscal rules. i totally understand why the hon."
1268,12/6/2000,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister," none of those steps has been easy. none of them happened without difficult decisions being made, including those on bank of england independence, measures to cut the deficit, performance-related pay for teachers, changing the basis of gps' contracts, incapacity and welfare reform, the private finance initiative, devolution, house of lords reform, the minimum wage, banning handguns, a more constructive relationship with europe   which was fought every inch of the way   the new deal and the working families tax credit. but the one thing of which we can be absolutely sure is that, whatever difficult decisions were needed to make that progress, each and every one was opposed by the conservative party."
1269,12/6/2000,Labour,labour,The Prime Minister,"what was he predicting then? he talked about a recession made in downing street, dangerous arrogance in giving the bank of england independence and hundreds of thousands about to lose their jobs. instead, his bandwagon lost its first wheel."
1270,12/6/2000,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Peter Luff," i have news for the government: they cannot do any such thing. they have done one thing right, for which i give them credit, and that was to give the bank of england independence. i think that it was an imperfect and incomplete independence, but it was the right thing to do."
1271,12/7/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Milburn,"i note that, to date, they have failed to do so.  these are measures, then, to build on the foundations that we have laid for a stronger economy and a fairer society: bank of england independence, the new deal, a statutory national minimum wage, the working families tax credit, record increases in child benefit, extra help for pensioners, and investment in our key public services. these are the foundations that we have laid   each and every one of them opposed by the conservative party."
1272,12/13/2000,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Portillo,"the opposition have a vision, founded on a disciplined approach to macro-economic management. we will be ruled by five disciplines: first, we will have our own currency; secondly, we will increase the independence of the bank of england; thirdly, we will set up a fiscal policy watchdog; fourthly, we will establish a national accounts commission; and fifthly, the government will spend only what the nation can afford. no, i shall keep going at this point."
1273,12/13/2000,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Portillo,that is a glaring gap at the centre of his policies.  we shall make the bank of england more independent. the chancellor wants to take away its powers.
1274,12/13/2000,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Portillo,"his policy is to let the european central bank set interest rates. at the next election, there will be only one party fighting for britain's interest rates to be set by an independent bank of england, and that will be the conservative party. i am not sure that that is an entirely new idea."
1275,12/13/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"member for huntingdon (mr. major) is here, and he would agree that the introduction of the wise men before the bank of england became independent was an innovation that happened under his government as they tried to meet the inflation target and sought independent advice. far from the idea being a great innovation in economic policy, it is simply a repetition of what has been done."
1276,12/13/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"the tory government refused to invest in the supply side of the economy   education and infrastructure   which is essential to sustain growth. they did not have monetary discipline and they are now reluctant and unclear converts to the independence of the bank of england. on the basis of one year's surplus they promised tax cuts for every year, which they knew they could not afford."
1277,12/13/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Taylor,"first, the government have followed the same fiscal rules that we proposed   and i do not knock them for that. secondly, we   unlike the labour party   proposed independence for the bank of england. we can claim some credit for that proposal."
1278,12/13/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Taylor,"our approach would have led to precisely the same balanced position that the government have achieved, because we would have balanced spending and taxes. it is the combined impact of all the government's policies   high tax, high interest rates and the semi-independent bank of england. had they had a different attitude towards tax and spend in the first couple of years, i suspect that the bank of england would have set different interest rates and we might have had a more acceptable exchange rate."
1279,12/13/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Andrew Miller,"instead, i want to look at the reality in my constituency. the principal actions of the government have created economic stability by giving the bank of england independence and implementing tough fiscal rules. in some respects, the first two years of this administration were painful in my constituency, but we are now beginning to see real benefits as a result of falling unemployment and massive reductions in mortgage rates, and those benefits will be sustained."
1280,12/13/2000,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"in fact, i shall offer a degree of bipartisanship on that question. the government are entitled to credit for having increased the independence of the bank of england, and for entrenching the discipline of counter-inflationary policy.  i can see that the hon."
1281,12/13/2000,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Dorrell,"there is broad, all-party agreement that the five-decade experiment with political money was an abject failure.  in case it is thought that i am offering unqualified support for every aspect of this part of government policy, i must say that the independence of the monetary policy committee of the bank of england would be significantly enhanced if almost all its members did not require the chancellor's say-so before their appointment was agreed.  in addition, i think that the monetary policy committee's independence, and the basis of knowledge on which it makes its decisions, would be substantially enhanced if we introduced into our structure something more closely akin to the american federal reserve or the old german bundesbank."
1282,12/13/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Roger Casale,"that strong and stable economy, which acts as a platform for our investment in public services' has not come about by chance, it is the result of the economic policies put in place by the chancellor of the exchequer.  the independence of the bank of england, new fiscal rules, prudence in public finances and borrowing only to invest are the golden rules. some of those issues are complex and technical, but everyone in wimbledon will understand the difference in the results."
1283,12/14/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown,"members: ""oh, no!""]
 i know that the right hon. gentleman agrees with me about the independence of the bank of england. i hope that he also agrees with me about the importance of monetary and fiscal stability."
1284,12/14/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown," it is to tackle precisely that problem that we have introduced changes. we have opened up competition policy by making the competition commission independent, in the same way as the bank of england is independent in making decisions.  the government are also moving forward in terms of labour market reform, capital market reform and product market reform."
1285,12/14/2000,Labour,labour,Mr. Brown," instead of attacking our policies, the shadow chancellor should start to consider whether he has a policy. yesterday's debate revealed to us that the conservatives have no fiscal rules; they will not invest in the supply side, which is the infrastructure of the economy; and their monetary disciplines are suspect because they would sack bank of england independence under certain circumstances, which they define as incompetence. at the same time they are promising tax cuts based on a surplus one year that they cannot guarantee for every year."
1286,12/14/2000,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Richard Ottaway,"but can the chief secretary confirm that his plan to scrap the pound means scrapping the monetary policy committee? can he confirm that, at the next election, there will be just one party campaigning for interest rates to be set by an independent bank of england   the conservative party? since we came into government, our first duty has been to secure economic stability."
1287,3/7/2001,Labour,labour,The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gordon Brown),"in 1997, with inflation rising, a Â£28 billion deficit and a national debt that had doubled, the british economy was once again at risk of repeating the old all too familiar pattern of inflation followed by recession.  there were many who opposed our decision to make the bank of england independent, others who opposed the tough controls on borrowing and spending, and many also who opposed our new fiscal rules and disciplines. there were some in this house who predicted that our policies would bring recession."
1288,3/7/2001,Labour,labour,Mr. Kidney,"799, c. 1231 “36.]
 a clear difference today is the welcome decision in 1997 to give independence to the bank of england to set interest rates without reference to the political cycle and the difficulties of the day.  what had happened to income tax rates by 1970?"
1289,3/8/2001,Labour,labour,The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Stephen Byers),"almost four years ago, we reformed the whole basis of economic policy making. we took tough decisions early to make the bank of england independent, to establish a proper fiscal framework, and to repay the national debt. consequently, inflation is now at a 30-year low, and is the lowest in europe."
1290,3/12/2001,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies," it is not by choice or by legacy that we are enjoying the current economic environment, but by decision and difficult choice. the bank of england's independence was one of the chancellor's first master strokes. it immediately took the risk premium out of interest rates."
1291,3/12/2001,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mr. Geraint Davies,"to 2 per cent. we should remember that the conservatives did not want a monetary policy committee; they did not want independence for the bank of england. now they have come round to the idea   in fact, they have gone a step further."
1292,3/12/2001,Labour,labour,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms),"lewis) reminded the house. the new macro-economic policy framework, with interest rates decided independently by the monetary policy committee of the bank of england and the rules of fiscal prudence, was needed to establish a new stability in the economy after decades of instability, compared with the record of our competitors. having achieved that, we see it as a precious prize indeed."
1293,3/13/2001,Labour,labour,The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Alan Milburn),"it has happened because of the choices that the government have made. new fiscal rules, independence for the bank of england, and new programmes to create jobs and to make work pay have all helped to secure prosperity and progress for our country.  each and every step of the way, those choices have been opposed by the conservative party."
1294,3/13/2001,Labour,labour,The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Alan Milburn),"today, britain has the lowest inflation that it has had for 30 years. the leader of the opposition said that independence for the bank of england was dangerous arrogance. today, britain has the lowest long-term interest rates for 35 years."
1295,3/13/2001,Labour,labour,The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Alan Milburn),"rather than a million jobs being lost, a million have been created. today's conservatives, therefore, have been wrong on economic performance, wrong on the bank of england's independence, wrong on ending poverty pay, and wrong on every prediction and forecast. not even michael fish gets it that wrong."
1296,3/13/2001,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Portillo,"we shall have our own currency, and interest rates will be set in britain. we shall enhance the independence of the bank of england and appoint an independent committee of economic advisers. we shall ensure that there are proper national accounts to end the chancellor's fiddled figures and we shall increase government spending within the limits of what the nation can afford."
1297,3/13/2001,Labour,labour,Mr. Radice," however, it is the present chancellor who has had the boldness to carry through the revolution in monetary and fiscal policy needed to achieve stability. he gave operational independence in monetary policy to the bank of england, and set up the monetary policy committee. it may be true that he has been lucky, but he has also made his own luck."
1298,3/13/2001,Labour,labour,Mr. Radice,it was his decision to give the bank of england independence and to stick by his predecessor's spending plans for the first two years. it was also his decision to keep to the fiscal rules that he had devised. one reason has been the mistakes made by the bank of england.
1299,3/13/2001,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Kenneth Clarke," i applaud the giving of independence to the bank of england, but i feel free to criticise the performance of the monetary policy committee. i have been on the doveish side of that divided committee throughout, and i believe that the doveish side was right. who borrowed an extra Â£28 billion before we came into office?"
1300,3/13/2001,Labour,labour,The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Andrew Smith),"in contrast, who, within days of coming into office, made the bank of england operationally independent? who put the fiscal rules in place? i found it revealing when the right hon."
1301,3/13/2001,Labour,labour,Mr. Smith,"and learned gentleman said in his speech that he saw merit in the way in which we acted to make the bank of england operationally independent. the question that he must answer is why he did not do that when he had the chance, if that is what he believed. we look forward to the monetary policy committee reducing interest rates."
1302,4/9/2001,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Davey,"i support an independent central bank, and believe that its independence should be guarded jealously, but it is right for us, as constituency members, to send signals that we believe that the economic situation on the ground is deteriorating significantly enough to warrant interest rate changes.  monetary policy needs to be directed towards helping agriculture, manufacturing and tourism, which were already suffering before foot and mouth and the us slow-down. we hear too much cant from both sides of the house about that."
1303,4/9/2001,Conservative,conservative,Mr. Ian Taylor,"everyone now accepts that we have given independence to the bank of england, and we shall possibly give it in the end to the european central bank, too. we must understand that fiscal policy needs to be a good deal more energetic than it has been in the past. as he said, we are on course to deliver stability and sustain growth."
1304,4/24/2001,Labour,labour,Miss Johnson,"one reason for that is our tough and decisive action in introducing tough fiscal rules, reducing the national debt and making the bank of england independent, which has succeeded in delivering the lowest rate of inflation for 30 years. in the last year.  no country can ever insulate itself from world economic events, but it is because of the decisive action that we have taken   introducing tough fiscal rules, reducing the national debt, making the bank of england independent and delivering the lowest inflation for 30 years   that british economic policy is much better placed than it has ever been in the past."
1305,4/25/2001,Labour,labour,The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Stephen Byers)," we are on course to continue to deliver stability and sustained growth, but it is an extremely difficult time for individuals and communities when jobs are lost as industries restructure in the face of change. the mass unemployment of the 1980s over which the then conservative government presided caused the greatest damage to the fight against child poverty. if the government have achieved only one thing by adopting the liberal democrats' policy of an independent central bank, thus ensuring stable economic growth, it has been to reduce unemployment by 1 million."
1306,5/9/2001,Liberal Democrat,Others,Mr. Edward Davey,"that has constituted the government's most effective attack on child poverty. today, we again signal ours: the economy, health, education and crime. i say to the leader of the opposition that of course we must look at ways of making parliament more effective, but the biggest thing that will repay people's faith in politics is our carrying out the programme on which we were elected.in our first term, we altered the entire system of economic management with bank of england independence and new fiscal rules, which have given britain today the lowest inflation in europe, 1 million more jobs in the economy and interest rates half what they were in 18 years of conservative government."
1307,6/20/2001,Labour,labour,Tony Blair,"i believe that today the labour government are the government of economic competence for our country. it is to deliver this decade what has eluded us for too long: faster productivity rises than our main industrial competitors. at any point in the past 20 years, it was open to a government to make not only the bank of england independent, but our competition authorities independent and free of political influence, to use the criminal law to outlaw cartels, to reform insolvency laws and remove crown preference, thus reducing the cost of business failure, to introduce an enterprise management incentive scheme for growing high-growth firms and to cut capital gains tax, as we have done, from 40 per cent."
1308,6/25/2001,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"to 10 per cent. that is the precise reverse of the position in the parliament up to 1997.inflation has remained low and stable, as it was when the government came to office, although the latest figures show that it has risen significantly. the chancellor was right to make the bank of england independent."
1309,6/25/2001,Conservative,conservative,Michael Portillo," [hon. i welcome his success with the european union and the commission in gaining agreement on the venture capital funds for regional development that he will make available. that is the final piece of the jigsaw for regional development agencies, which will not only have funds of their own, but be able to afford access to additional moneys for businesses that need support and assistance.it has already been said that perhaps the most telling aspect of the government's approach was shown by one of their first actions in the early days of the previous parliament when they established the independence of the bank of england."
1310,6/25/2001,Labour,labour,Martin O'Neill,"the shadow chancellor made an interesting point about lengthening individuals' service on the monetary policy committee, but only for one term. i am delighted also that the right hon. member for kensington and chelsea added a fresh conversion to the list: we have seen him turn from opposition to independence for the bank of england to full support for it."
1311,6/25/2001,Labour,labour,Patricia Hewitt,"we have also seen him turn from voting against the minimum wage to supporting it, if reluctantly.this evening, the right hon. largely, however, it is due to the overall economic success that we are now enjoying. that is the result of the prudent economic management of the economy, and not least the independence of the bank of england, which has guaranteed low interest rates and low inflation rates."
1312,7/13/2001,Labour (Co-op),labour,Geraint Davies,"proper cost control by my right hon. we must examine the entire picture rather than take an opportunistic approach, as the opposition do, and try to pick off little bits and misrepresent the impact of red tape. when the chancellor said that our recent interest rate cut was co-ordinated with other countries, did he mean the treasury requested the bank of england to take that action or that the bank of england decided independently to go beyond its normal remit and timing for those changes?"
1313,10/15/2001,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"i am not against the change; i would just like to know the process by which it took place. the individual authorities   the bank of england, the federal reserve bank and the european central bank   make their own decisions about interest rates. i know that many opposition members resisted our decision to make the bank of england independent, but it is independent and makes its own decisions.i was referring to what i thought and feel able comment on; everybody here should be able to do that."
1314,10/15/2001,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"following the decisive action by the relevant authorities, there was a boost to the world economy at a most difficult time. lady might also like to note that the rail regulator told the select committee that what the secretary of state had done put under threat virgin projects for the purchase of tilting trains for the west coast main line   a line which i know is of particular interest to the hon. lady   and for its new country networks, and had put under threat the independence of the bank of england as well."
1315,11/13/2001,Conservative,conservative,Theresa May,perhaps the hon. we also need stability in the economy. most rational politicians think that an independent bank of england and inflation target are useful contributors to a stable economy.we need stability of pension rules.
1316,11/13/2001,Labour,labour,David Kidney,"it is vital when we try to persuade people to take out pensions that they are confident that as much as possible of their investment will accrue to their pension fund throughout their working life, and that they will not be robbed of great chunks of their investment every time they change from one scheme or one job to another.the public policy tools that politicians have are the basic state pension, the pension credit, regulation and partnership with the private sector. that certainly occurred under the conservative government, and i suspect one or two people may be wondering how tom winsor managed to get appointed by the present administration.there have also been some increases in arm's length administration. i am not sure whether the government would define the increased independence of the bank of england's monetary policy committee as the creation of a quango, but it has been universally regarded as a success and is supported by my party."
1317,11/16/2001,Conservative,conservative,Tim Collins,"that shows that there has been a shift in the way in which we are governed, and we support that. indeed, in every major global slowdown since 1945, britain has entered weaker, suffered longer, experienced higher inflation and endured higher unemployment. so it is at a time like this that our new monetary and fiscal regime   bank of england independence, the symmetrical inflation target, our new fiscal rules and the tough decisions we have taken to reduce debt   is being tested.when the world turned down in 1998, decisive action by the newly independent bank of england ensured that the british economy sustained its growth."
1318,11/27/2001,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"throughout 2001 britain has continued to grow, and monetary policy has played its full part. we have 1 million more jobs as a result of what we have done. he opposed bank of england independence and he was wrong."
1319,11/27/2001,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"he has said in the past few weeks that we are the worst economy of any when it comes to facing up to the future, and we have the highest growth in the oecd this year   so he is wrong again. the most important thing that we can do for manufacturing is to provide a stable economic climate. by making the bank of england independent and putting in place tough new fiscal rules, we have taken the necessary measures to ensure that."
1320,12/6/2001,Labour,labour,Ruth Kelly,"artificially to manipulate the exchange rate of the pound as the hon. that may not matter with a small regulator, but if one bonds together all the different regulators and the body's political independence is compromised, the consequences will be serious. that is why the bill should contain an independent mechanism for the appointment of the chairman and the board members.i commend to ministers the experience of the bank of england."
1321,1/14/2002,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"i sat on the select committee on the treasury when the monetary policy committee was being set up. i endorse his argument that ofcom must be independent. the competition act 1980, the enterprise bill and the independence given to the bank of england are proof that we have been moving in that direction over the past five years, and i see no sign that that will not continue."
1322,2/28/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"increasingly, it is making itself more accountable to both the governments and the people of europe. it must, of course, remain an independent central bank. those of us who supported the making independent of the bank of england recognise the importance of the european central bank being independent of the decision-making processes of politicians."
1323,3/14/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"with permission, mr. would disappear in a reasonable period of time.""that is exactly why the competition commission has proposed the transitional remedies on which the shadow chancellor   because he has not faced up to these questions   is silent this morning.the report says that""lack of competition has permitted and would continue to permit overcharging of smes for these services.""the competition commission does not believe that, even given additional new entrants into the market, behavioural remedies   entry and more competition   will of themselves have sufficient effect on services to small businesses over the next two or three years. that is why the director general of fair trading has recommended the transitional remedies.i hope that, just as after a time consensus was reached on the independence of the bank of england and acceptance of its interest rate decisions, consensus can now be reached on the independent competition authorities."
1324,3/14/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"i hope that after some reflection the conservative party will agree not only that competition is right in general, but that the specific remedies that have been recommended are necessary if we are to do our best by the 3.5 million small businesses in this country. she will not be able to do anything. there is a radical change in that policy area, and checks and balances must be built in.when the bank of england was made independent of day-to-day political interference, checks and balances were provided, in the form of parliamentary accountability through the select committee on the treasury."
1325,4/10/2002,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"i was part of that process, and it worked admirably. we have a tendency not to learn from other countries, and to think that because we started it we know best. however, central bank independence and the way we have run the economy show that we have learned lessons and benefited from them."
1326,4/12/2002,Labour,labour,Brian White,"the government are to be commended for learning those lessons and applying them here.because there is an assumption that independent regulators are a good thing, the automatic answer is to have a regulator, but that assumption is not necessarily correct and i ask the minister to accept that there is a need to challenge it.there is a need for regulators to provide proper information, but the problem is that some of the information provided by the companies is commercial in confidence. friend the chancellor said in 1997 that that approach would have to be changed. his brave act, against all the odds, was to give the bank of england independence."
1327,4/17/2002,Labour,labour,John McFall,"monetary issues have been taken away from politicians and placed with economists. as chairman of the treasury select committee, i know that sir eddie george and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee are accountable to the chancellor and parliament through our committee. that is much healthier than having monthly meetings between a chancellor and a governor of the bank of england.there is independence for the bank of england, and a symmetrical inflation target has been set, which has been a guiding principle in the economy."
1328,4/17/2002,Labour,labour,John McFall,"the mpc has met that target consistently since 1997.i was in brussels yesterday for a meeting of the european parliament's chairpersons' budget committee. we need to think through the structures more carefully. incidentally, i welcomed some years ago the granting of independence to the bank of england."
1329,4/17/2002,Conservative,conservative,Andrew Tyrie,"indeed, i would have liked the chancellor to go further in those reforms.so, there are some things that the chancellor has done with which i agree, but i do not think this is a good budget, although it could become a crucial budget in the political landscape of britain. economic stability is crucial to business confidence, critical to secure investment and important to secure enterprise.the fundamentals for economic stability are clearly in place. we put a key one in place when we came into office by giving the bank of england its operational independence."
1330,4/17/2002,Labour,labour,James Plaskitt,"that has delivered low, stable interest rates, which play a crucial role in delivering a stable economy. there most certainly is, and it is perfectly right and proper that businesses can contribute to that just as much as individuals can.i was in the process of listing the fundamentals that need to be in place to tackle the productivity agenda, and i mentioned monetary policy. interestingly, there is now very little argument in the house about the positive contribution that has resulted from introducing the independence of the bank of england, although there was at the time of its introduction."
1331,4/17/2002,Labour,labour,James Plaskitt,"fiscal discipline has also played a key part, and continues to do so. i am as proud of that as i am to be a member of the gmb trade union.labour is also the party of fairness, and today's budget is one for the public services. millions of people throughout the country will benefit as we generate an economy that brings prosperity to the country as a whole.the decision to give the bank of england independence on interest rates was bold and courageous."
1332,4/17/2002,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mark Hendrick,"as the chancellor said, since then, there have been seven cuts in interest rates. secondly, it will debunk all the myths thrown out by the conservative party, which wants to denigrate the services provided in this country and the people who work in them and to leave an impression that things are far worse than they really are. in the previous labour government, the chancellor achieved through, first, independence for the bank of england, and, following that, low and stable interest rates and growing employment, an important reversal   that of labour's reputation for economic incompetence.i hope that this budget will mark another change   a change in the way that politics works."
1333,4/17/2002,Labour,labour,Fiona Mactaggart,"for some years, we have experienced a sort of ersatz politics, in which politicians have become so expert at presenting policies in the best light that people have begun to believe that all politicians are interested in treating them like fools and patronising them. so we have exactly the same phenomenon   we have endless fiddling, tinkering interventions, with no impact on the thing that the chancellor claims he is trying to address.the pattern with this chancellor is that he is best at the things in which he is not interested. his biggest single triumph as chancellor was to take his hands off monetary policy and give independence to the central bank."
1334,4/18/2002,Conservative,conservative,David Willetts," [interruption.] yes, we now recognise that that has been a great success. we support it and believe that it has significantly improved the conduct of british macro- economic policy. the chancellor's giving the conduct of monetary policy to an independent central bank has worked."
1335,4/18/2002,Conservative,conservative,David Willetts,"since then, however, he has put his restless intellectual energies and those of his department into other objectives   productivity and the tax credits   and that is where he is failing to deliver. for the record, will the hon. gentleman remind the house of which of the three main parties included the independence of the central bank in its 1997 manifesto?"
1336,4/18/2002,Conservative,conservative,David Willetts,i thought that there were only two main parties. i presume from the hon. gentleman's leading question that perhaps the party that he represents advocated an independent central bank.
1337,4/18/2002,Conservative,conservative,David Willetts,"jack) is in his place, and he will know that we had already made progress towards that policy before 1997. nevertheless, it has been a great success, but if the chancellor looks at his table on long-term interest rates, he will clearly see that those rates were already falling in the mid-1990s, as we gave greater operational independence to the bank of england.i will not cavil, however. we welcome the achievement of the independent central bank, but the chancellor should not then have started to fiddle with other things instead."
1338,4/18/2002,Conservative,conservative,David Willetts,"the more attention a policy gets, the less successful its delivery. five years ago and in successive budgets, we set a course for stability in the economy not just for one or two years, but for the long term. we took the necessary tough decisions right at the start of that parliament, and we took more necessary decisions yesterday.it is interesting that the shadow secretary of state gave us credit for one policy   giving independence to the bank of england."
1339,4/18/2002,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"as he rightly said, that has been one of the principal ingredients in building that long-term economic stability. gentleman then had the gall to say that the conservatives were secretly in favour of that policy and were working towards something that we always thought they opposed. that casts new light on what was going on in the treasury when they were in government: they were making steady progress towards something that they said on every occasion they were against.indeed, the only time that i ever heard conservative politicians say that they were in favour of an independent bank of england was when a chancellor left office."
1340,4/18/2002,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"when they made their resignation speeches, they said that they were in favour of something that they had always said they opposed. perhaps that explains why 10 years ago to this very year, the conservative government presided over a catastrophic mess in the economy, which largely contributed to their defeat four years later. on the monetary policy committee and the independence of the central bank, is it not the case that, if that has been a success, one reason is that the government have been protected from their own back benchers when they have pressed the government to break the inflation target?"
1341,4/18/2002,Conservative,conservative,Michael Spicer,"when i was on the treasury committee, we were constantly faced with labour members trying to get the government to break the inflation target. member for fylde (mr. jack) who, i recall, spent many happy years in the treasury secretly working towards the independence of the bank of england."
1342,4/18/2002,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,"no, not at the moment. that is what conservative members were responsible for when they had stewardship of our economy. we have made the bank of england independent, a step that the shadow chancellor described at the time as damaging to the future of this country."
1343,4/18/2002,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,"conservative members have changed their minds. our opponents warned that the minimum wage would cost 1 million jobs, but in fact, there are 1.5 million more jobs in the economy than when we took office.none of that has come about by chance. it has happened because of the choices that we have made: new fiscal rules, bank of england independence, and new programmes to create jobs and make work pay."
1344,4/23/2002,Labour,labour,Alan Milburn,"all those initiatives were introduced by this labour government, and all were opposed by the conservatives. extra national insurance cost will devastate local industry and be a tax on jobs. i am confident that that prediction will be as accurate as their prediction about the independence of the bank of england and the possible cost in jobs of the minimum wage.i do not deny that my constituency still has a long way to go before reaching the affluence of some areas, but unemployment in the most deprived ward has dropped from 25 per cent."
1345,4/23/2002,Labour (Co-op),labour,Adrian Bailey,"in 1994, to 8 per cent. no.interestingly, labour's key policy changes after the last election and the 1997 election were based on liberal democrat manifesto commitments made in the campaigns. in 1997, in order to move away from the conservative policies of boom and bust and failed economic management, the labour government rightly adopted our policy of establishing an independent central bank."
1346,4/30/2002,Liberal Democrat,Others,Ed Davey," [laughter.] labour members laugh, but the proposal was not set out in their manifesto, so they should wipe the smiles off their faces. perhaps they will be more amused by my next observation. it was interesting to hear conservative front benchers try to take credit in the budget debate for the independent central bank policy, when they had opposed it in government."
1347,4/30/2002,Liberal Democrat,Others,Ed Davey,"it beggars belief that the conservative opposition are trying to take credit for that policy.however, after the 2001 election, labour has now adopted our policy of raising tax to invest in the public services. we urge the government to work with other member states to find agreement on the definition and interpretation of the stability and growth pact as soon as possible.""the committee is making a wide-ranging inquiry into europe, and i hope in the next few months that we will be able to visit the european central bank and speak to wim duisenberg and others. however, we will go charged with the belief that the government's actions with regard to the monetary policy committee and independence for the bank of england have been good."
1348,4/30/2002,Labour,labour,John McFall,"the committee urges the government to begin a dialogue with other countries to find the best solution to such matters.in conclusion, i am aware that the government have tried, with this budget, to build a consensus with regard to the welfare state. gentleman is highly respected in the city for those budgets. his prudent phase was highly respected on three grounds in particular.the first is that he gave independence to the bank of england."
1349,4/30/2002,Conservative,conservative,Andrew Mitchell,"i can say with honesty   it is recorded in hansard   that i was in favour of such a measure 10 or 12 years ago when the conservative party was against it. we passed the first house of lords act 1999, the human rights act 1998 and the freedom of information act 2000. we have given the bank of england independence in the setting of interest rates."
1350,5/13/2002,Labour,labour,Robin Cook,"last week, the deputy prime minister set out our plans to allow the creation of regional assemblies in those regions of england that vote for them. gentleman will find that, when he talks to businesses in his constituency, what they want most of all is economic stability. the fact that, as a result of making the bank of england independent and of the new fiscal and monetary regime that we have introduced, we have had greater stability over the last five years than we had in the previous 18 years, shows the value of policies for stability against the old boom and bust."
1351,7/4/2002,Liberal Democrat,Others,Ed Davey,"may i start by agreeing with a major point made by the hon. he said that the paymaster general's opening remarks describing the performance of the british economy and its management under the government were far too rosy; i would say that they were panglossian. there may have been successes in the last five years, particularly bank of england independence and the increased stability that that has given to monetary policy, which liberal democrats have welcomed on many occasions."
1352,7/4/2002,Liberal Democrat,Others,Ed Davey,"to suggest that the whole picture of the macro-economy is rosy, however, is far from the truth.i suggest to the paymaster general that, rather than simply reading the briefing from treasury officials, she should go to the house of commons library to read the latest research paper on economic indicators, published this week. gentleman makes a valid point, and i refer him to the report of the committee that debated the bill. i served on that committee and argued for target independence for the bank of england, so that the monetary policy committee could set its own targets instead of the chancellor doing it   in the same way as the european central bank does."
1353,7/4/2002,Liberal Democrat,Others,Ed Davey,"i argued that because if the markets think that the chancellor may use that remaining power to set targets and thus affect interest rates and the exchange rate, that will undermine the credibility of the inflation rate.long-term interest rates show some evidence that we are still paying a premium in the uk. we have slightly higher long-term interest rates than many other of our competitor countries. that slight premium exists partly because the bank of england does not have target independence."
1354,7/4/2002,Liberal Democrat,Others,Ed Davey," [interruption.] if hon. flight) have accused the government of being panglossian   of putting too rosy a glow on our economic success. i am the first to admit that there is great uncertainty about the world economic outlook, but the fact is that the macro-economic framework that we have put in place is the right one.on coming to power in 1997, we gave the bank of england independence, and an independent monetary policy committee is delivering pro-growth low inflation."
1355,7/4/2002,Labour,labour,Ruth Kelly,"it has the right symmetrical inflation target to deliver the dual objectives of growth and low inflation. is he opposing the fact that there are 20,000 more teachers in schools and 100,000 more students at university and that we are reforming secondary, further and higher education? in five years, we have made more reforms than the conservatives made in their 18 years.as for economic reform, we made the bank of england independent, which the conservatives opposed."
1356,7/15/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"we created the financial services authority; they opposed it. he was employment secretary when unemployment went up by 1 million, and was home secretary when crime doubled. we made the bank of england independent and set it an inflation target of 2Â½ per cent."
1357,7/18/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"it is the duty of the bank to meet that target and it has done so for the past three to four years. cut in youth and long-term unemployment, and unemployment is lower than in america, japan and the euro area.if we had taken the advice of the conservative party, we would have made the wrong decisions. we made the bank of england independent, and the conservatives opposed that; we created the financial services authority, but the conservatives opposed it; we created the new deal, and they opposed that, too."
1358,7/18/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"they advised us not to implement the minimum wage; the shadow chancellor went around the country saying that it would cost 1 million jobs. redwood), who is waiting to pounce on the shadow chancellor, must despair of those on the conservative front bench and the way in which they put their case about the national economy. we have created greater stability by making the bank of england independent   but initially the shadow chancellor opposed that."
1359,7/18/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"we have created a better competitive framework by making the competition commission independent   and originally the conservatives opposed it. member for arundel and south downs was talking about private insurance, which is the reform that the conservative party has in store for this country should it ever again have the opportunity to exercise power.the spending review is focused around four key objectives: raising productivity so that britain can be more prosperous; extending opportunity by investing in education; creating strong and secure communities matching rights with responsibilities; and, in relation to britain and the wider world, maximising the opportunities for our country and for managing globalisation and minimising the insecurities of the world in which we live. economic stability and sound public finances are the basis upon which better public services can be delivered.difficult decisions had to be taken in the first term   the independence of the bank of england, tough fiscal rules and strict control of the public finances."
1360,7/23/2002,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,"no one could pretend for one moment that any of that was easy, but it worked and it provided the basis on which to build. there would be none, because the schools would provide education at the same cost as that provided by the state. that is how the state scholarship would work.we would also build trust in an independent exam system by making the qualifications and curriculum authority independent of government, along the lines of the bank of england."
1361,11/15/2002,Conservative,conservative,Damian Green,"i hope that the government will adopt a similar proposal. and learned gentleman because his contributions give an added dimension to tory party thinking, given that he normally disagrees with his front-bench colleagues, and i have followed carefully what he has been saying over the last few years. he said in 1997 that he was against the independence of the bank of england and he predicted that there would be a recession."
1362,11/18/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"he then said that we were wrong not to keep to the spending rules when we cut debt so that we are in a position to borrow at times that are more difficult for the economy, and he now says that our spending is unacceptable. does anyone know? does anyone care?during the 1980s and 1990s, when other countries were making decisions on central bank independence, the conservatives could have made the bank of england independent."
1363,11/18/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"even after 1997   even after we had made the bank of england independent   the shadow chancellor continued to oppose the decision.what of the fiscal disciplines? i see that it is now the shadow chancellor's argument that ours are too lax, despite the fact that in a speech in april he said that neither of the government's fiscal rulesxis entirely new. we will pursue them into every constituency to explain what their plans will mean for british families and people across britain."
1364,11/18/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"i did not say that; i said that after 1997 we, first, made the bank of england independent; secondly, we devised a new monetary regime that was based, unlike the tories' regime, on a symmetrical inflation target; and, thirdly, we introduced new fiscal rules so that we could reduce the debt, which rose under the conservatives, by not spending additional moneys over the first two years. the result is that we have cut debt, which had been rising under the conservatives, from 44 per cent. gentleman would want to congratulate us on our prudence and the stability that we have tried to create for the british economy.having created a platform of greater stability with clear monetary and fiscal rules   unlike those of the conservative party   the next stage is to make britain better equipped to face the new challenges of globalisation, with more competition, more business creation, more investment and a more skilled work force."
1365,11/18/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"so, in the queen's speech, we have matched last session's enterprise act 2002 with measures that will open up competition, which will be in a water bill; with measures that will reduce barriers to entrepreneurship; and with measures to reduce planning delays by introducing business planning zones, which will be in a planning bill.at any point in the past 20 years, it was open to the government of the day to make our competition authorities, like the bank of england, independent and free of political influence. at any point, it was open to them to reform the insolvency laws. it is one of the many reasons why, at an international level, the british government are working for an early resumption of the world trade talks and why, at a european level, we must curb industrial and agricultural protectionism.while the present political and economic uncertainties   the continuing aftermath of 11 september, unfolding events in iraq, the impact on oil prices, concerns about equities and corporate standards, continuing trouble in the it sector and current account imbalances   have all caused business investment to fall sharply since 2000 in every major continent, the challenge for the british economy in this more uncertain and unstable world has been to steer a stable course, combining low and stable inflation with sustained demand growth and with high levels of employment.i can report that 175,000 more people are in employment in the british economy this year than last year and in total 1Â½ million more work force jobs have been created since 1997."
1366,11/27/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"our unemployment rate is lower than in japan, america and the euro area for the first time for 50 years.our monetary and fiscal foundation, which is based on the independence of the bank of england, imposes a symmetrical target for inflation, requires debt at low levels, holds to tough fiscal rules over the economic cycle and is thus designed not just for times of high growth, but for a global contraction with all its attendant difficulties. it is because the bank of england has established credibility through year after year meeting our 2Â½ per cent. and 1Â½ per cent."
1367,11/27/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"for the next three years.so, in both monetary and fiscal policy, with the lowest inflation and the lowest long-term interest rates for 40 years, as well as the lowest unemployment for 25 years   and we are able to meet our spending plans in full   the right approach is to hold firm to our long-term course.as i conclude this section on monetary and fiscal policy, i wish to thank sir edward george, whose period of office as governor of the bank of england ends in june next year, for the steady hand he has consistently shown in the leadership of the monetary policy committee since we made the bank of england independent in 1997. in welcoming the announcement this afternoon of the appointment by her majesty the queen of the new governor of the bank of england   the deputy governor for the last five years, mr. of gdp and forced us to cut it, and if he had not left an inflationary problem that had to be dealt with by raising interest rates in the first days after we came into government."
1368,11/27/2002,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"i must therefore look at his record in the context of high debt, his failure to make the bank of england independent, and the high inflation that he left us.  [interruption.] that rising inflation had to be met by rising interest rates when we came into government.on the right hon. very significant, it will surprise no one to know."
1369,12/12/2002,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,we took some hard decisions in the early days of this government   decisions that conservative members opposed   such as those relating to the independence of the bank of england and to our public spending plans. taking those decisions has put us in a position to weather the international storm. why did he do so?
1370,2/12/2003,Labour,labour,Kali Mountford,"he was worried about the election, but even that decision did not buy the election result for which the conservatives hoped.that is why the current chancellor rightly dealt with the bank of england and said that we must be independent and that interest rates should not be tied to the electoral benefits or disbenefits of the government of the day. it was perfectly correct to do that and it is right that that freedom exists for the bank of england, but the conservative party never had the guts to introduce it, as they had to have control to fool the electorate repeatedly and bribe them by saying ""we should not take this measure now, but we need to deal now with taxes, interest rates and the retail price index."" at each general election, they had to buy off the public. and inflation at almost 10 per cent.we do not need to look only at the conservatives' record in government; let us consider their record when they were   as they are now and as they will remain   in opposition."
1371,2/12/2003,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,"they opposed the independence of the bank of england; they opposed the new deal; and they opposed the minimum wage, yet they have the nerve to take us to task on our economic competence and the stewardship of my right hon. friend the chancellor.the conservatives want to talk about public services. in the fourth quarter of this year and will be 2Â½ per cent."
1372,4/9/2003,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"next year, for every one of the following years.before bank of england independence, the pre-1997 inflation target was 2Â½ per cent. or less but market expectations of uk inflation five, 10 and 20 years ahead were around 4Â½ per cent., almost double the target.today in 2003 because of the success of the monetary regime we introduced in 1997   and i pay tribute to the retiring governor of the bank of england, sir edward george, and the monetary policy committee   we have a symmetric inflation target of 2Â½ per cent. gentleman is right, but the right hon."
1373,4/9/2003,Labour,labour,Barry Gardiner,"and learned gentleman was a member of the government when inflation was in double figures.the success has been largely achieved by the chancellor's initiative back in 1997 to pass control of monetary policy to an independent bank of england. in turn, that has led to historically low interest rates helping to foster investment and to stimulate and sustain demand during difficult economic periods. since we came into office."
1374,4/10/2003,Labour,labour,Andrew Smith,"the difference is that he can talk, but we can deliver.if we look at the budget in the round, it is clear that because of the tough decisions that labour has taken over the past six years   making the bank of england independent, bringing public finances under control   britain is better placed than other countries, and better placed than it was in the past, to withstand the global downturn and to benefit when world economic recovery begins. we have the lowest inflation for 30 years, the lowest interest rates for 40 years and the highest levels of employment in our history.the hon. they certainly did not happen because we followed the advice of those on the conservative front bench."
1375,4/10/2003,Labour,labour,Andrew Smith,"after all, the conservatives opposed bank of england independence, the fiscal rules, the new deal, public investment and even the working families tax credit, the loss of which the hon. gentleman lamented. i did not simply point to the '70s and the '80s; i pointed to the '90s as well   not that long ago   when, under the conservatives, inflation was in excess of 10 per cent."
1376,4/10/2003,Labour,labour,Andrew Smith,"the reason why there is now greater economic stability, 1.5 million more people in jobs and many more businesses thriving in our country is that we have been building an economy on a sound macro-economic foundation, following tough, firm and clear fiscal rules, assisted by the independence of the bank of england. by contrast, he refused to put firm fiscal rules in place and opposed the independence of the bank of england. i refer the house to the business interests recorded in the register of members' interests.i begin with a complaint about the budget timetable."
1377,4/11/2003,Conservative,conservative,Bill Wiggin,"gentleman, who represents anglesey, or ynys mon, as i should say in the spirit of bilingualism. it is a pleasure to have him intervene, because it is particularly important to recognise that if the government want credit for low interest rates, they should stop trying to take credit for making the bank of england independent. they cannot have it both ways: either make the bank independent and live with the results or take credit for the low interest rates."
1378,4/11/2003,Labour,labour,David Wright,"most of their responses to the government's proposals, including budgets, have opposed all that we have done to achieve long-term economic stability. they opposed bank of england independence, and opposed our tough fiscal rules. they opposed the new deal, and continue to do so."
1379,4/11/2003,Labour,labour,John Healey,"however, britain entered this period of uncertainty from a position of relative strength. since 1997, our monetary policy and the independent bank of england, supported by fiscal policy and our two golden rules, have established consistently low inflation and, crucially, low inflation expectations. we have established long-term interest rates that are lower now than those in germany, the euro area and america."
1380,4/14/2003,Liberal Democrat,Others,Matthew Taylor,"above all, it is built on private sector borrowing that has been fuelled by the growth in the value of house prices and massive levels of equity withdrawal. that consumption has been running at levels far beyond the growth in the underlying economy.nobody   not the bank of england, not independent financial experts and not even the chancellor   believes that such consumption fed by growth in house prices and more borrowing at rates above the underlying growth in the economy can continue for ever. we all know that there is a limit to how high house prices can go relative to incomes."
1381,4/14/2003,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"in part, this reputation is justified. probably the best thing that the chancellor ever did   and ever will do   was making the bank of england independent. we have seen some of the benefits of that, but the problem is that it has not been fully matched through fiscal policy."
1382,4/14/2003,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"true, there is a fiscal policy framework and fiscal targets, but the problem in terms of stability and long-term credibility is that the chancellor measures his own performance. that differs markedly from the bank of england, which has a very sound structure, real transparency and real independence. no comparable organisation exists on the fiscal policy side.let me give one or two examples."
1383,4/14/2003,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,"will he deny that that is how he described his government's economic record? the fact of the matter is that the conservatives opposed the independence of the bank of england, the fiscal rules and the new deal funded from the windfall levy, as did the liberal democrats. they opposed a national minimum wage, more help for families through tax credits and help for the poorest pensioners."
1384,5/6/2003,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,"members would expect. i celebrate the fact that it was this government who had the good sense to make the bank of england independent, which the opposition opposed and would never have had the guts to do. one would hope that at least one of them would have the good grace to stand up and congratulate us on the steps that we have taken."
1385,5/6/2003,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,"no, the hon. gentleman has much too much form for us to believe that he is about to stand up to congratulate us on allowing our central bank the independence that was its due and that has so benefited the economy. i am pleased to follow the right hon."
1386,5/6/2003,Labour (Co-op),labour,Geraint Davies,"cut that we would otherwise have.it is all very well saying. ""lots of money has been spent, but what is there to see for it?"" the reality is that, thanks to the stability that we created by making the bank of england independent and through prudent management, the british economy now has 1.5 million more people paying tax instead of taking benefits. because britain is working again and because we have macroeconomic stability and such things as working families tax credit to make work pay, we have people back at work, providing money."
1387,5/6/2003,Conservative,conservative,Mark Simmonds,"out, and the borrowing forecast is a dramatic Â£27 billion this year alone   a sum totalling Â£110 billion over the next five years. that is on the basis of what most independent commentators, including the institute for fiscal studies and the bank of england, believe are over-optimistic growth forecasts.the chancellor has calculated his sums perversely and incorrectly. he should first assess the economic growth and then calculate the size of the tax revenue stream and therefore how much we can afford to spend as a country, not, as he has done, decide the spending levels and then assess his economic growth predictions to fit."
1388,5/6/2003,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"beard), and, as far as i can work out, he still blames the gnomes of zurich for the problems that the wilson and callaghan governments ran into. he has not learned the proper lessons of macro-economics.the single greatest achievement of this labour government was to put the levers of macro-economic power out of their reach by giving the bank of england independence, and it was a jolly good thing that they did. the problem now, however, is that the labour party does not understand micro-economics."
1389,5/6/2003,Conservative,conservative,David Cameron,"we also visit a lot of businesses, but i find that there is nothing quite like spending a few hours every now and again in a business, looking at its problems and the costs that it faces, trying to understand more about the market that it is in and what is happening to that vital thing in the economy   sentiment.i do not say that the government have got it all wrong on the economy. giving independence to the bank of england was the right step, and it has had a positive effect. i repeat what i said in an intervention, i think, on the speech made by the hon."
1390,6/9/2003,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"since 1997, every economic decision of this government has been designed to build and then entrench stability in order to achieve for britain high and stable levels of employment and growth. that commitment to put stability first led us to adopt a new fiscal and monetary regime, to make the bank of england independent, and to cut debt substantially, and it has given us low inflation, low interest rates and low unemployment. that commitment to long-term stability, growth and employment is the foundation of our decisions today.central to the pursuit of stability, growth and employment by governments of both parties has been our membership of the european union."
1391,7/1/2003,Liberal Democrat,Others,David Laws,"with the increase in council tax being forced through by the measures being taken by the chancellor   one of the most regressive taxes that the government have yet thought up   we are not surprised that they do not intend to produce that series, as it would show how regressive certain elements of their tax policy are.when we link all that to the government's economic performance, we see a government who came in initially in 1997 with a clear and, in certain respects, ambitious agenda. they gave the central bank of the united kingdom operational independence, even though that was not in their manifesto, and we welcomed that. they had a clear agenda, whether or not one agreed with it, on public expenditure, and they wanted to restore the public finances to a strong state."
1392,7/7/2003,Labour,labour,Nigel Beard,"i am attempting to outline the broad structure of government policy in which public service agreements and, therefore, targets fit. psas form a major part of the government's programme of investment by ensuring that the investment achieves what people voted for and wanted.the other big rules in the strategy were the independence of the bank of england and a target of 2.5 per cent. inflation   i wonder whether that will be condemned with all the others   with the rate kept within 1 per cent."
1393,7/10/2003,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"i assure him that we will do nothing in any decision that we make to put the basic stability of the british economy at risk. it is precisely because we will not put the british economy's stability at risk that we introduced independence for the bank of england and our new fiscal and monetary regime. it is also precisely for that reason that we will take no risks in the euro assessment, which will be conducted with rigour and in a way that is both transparent and comprehensive."
1394,7/10/2003,Liberal Democrat,Others,David Laws,gentleman for that intervention. he and his party seem to have changed their minds about having an independent central bank in this country. it operates monetary policy much more effectively than was the case in the days of the right hon.
1395,7/10/2003,Conservative,conservative,John Bercow,"gentleman asks a fair question, but the difference is simple. the bank of england has operational independence, but parliament can always change its remit. the same does not apply to the european central bank."
1396,7/10/2003,Liberal Democrat,Others,David Laws,"i was not aware that the hon. gentleman was previously an ardent advocate of operational independence for the uk central bank. it is not i who wrote that record book, but lord lawson."
1397,7/10/2003,Liberal Democrat,Others,David Laws,"gentleman go back and reread it. if he does, he will see why lord lawson recommended that there should be an operationally independent central bank   it was because he was subjected to bullying from the then prime minister. the book also shows that lord lawson also recommended a constitutional settlement for the eu."
1398,7/10/2003,Conservative,conservative,Michael Portillo,"yes, i accept that. it is why i am pleased that we have an independent bank of england. i am also pleased that i was the person in the conservative party in the position of accepting an independent bank of england as a good thing."
1399,7/10/2003,Conservative,conservative,Michael Portillo,it is one thing that has provided us with a little more stability. we may be creating institutions with completely separate monetary and fiscal policies at the very time when more fiscal and monetary co-ordination is needed. we may have created an independent bank of england while looking at the rear-view mirror when we should have been looking at the windscreen.
1400,7/10/2003,Conservative,conservative,Andrew Tyrie,"i am not predicting deflation, which would of course mean our needing much more fiscal and monetary co-ordination; but it is a risk. fiscal and monetary policy are made in virtual isolation. the ecb is even more independent than the bank of england is now."
1401,7/10/2003,Conservative,conservative,Andrew Tyrie,"we do not have to join emu now, so why take the risk? gentleman's government made an excellent decision in making the bank of england independent   it had not been done before and it proved successful   and with that in mind i would encourage him to be a little more far-sighted here. i can see absolutely no downside to making the qualifications and curriculum authority independent; indeed, doing so would provide considerable strengths."
1402,10/21/2003,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"they would discover that euroland, the decisive bloc within the eu, is on autopilot under an unelected official   the governor of the european central bank. unlike in the uk, where an elected chancellor of the exchequer and an elected cabinet could call the so-called independent governor of the bank of england to heel, change the rules, issue new instructions or, in extremis, change the personnel, meps have no such influence or control, because the central bank was deliberately set up to ensure that there was no democratic accountability and that dreadful politicians had no influence over it.let us consider alternatively the emerging settlement in the european constitution for the conduct of foreign policy. again, in the british parliament, a good tradition is established."
1403,11/13/2003,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"i hope that in the spirit of cross-party agreement the right hon. gentleman agrees not only that it was right to make the bank of england independent, but that the policies we have pursued since 1997   which, uniquely among all the major industrial economies, have secured growth while other economies have experienced recession   are right.let me welcome the shadow chancellor to his new post   we will enjoy our economic debates with him. we were sorry that he mysteriously disappeared during the election campaign of 2001, so we welcome him back."
1404,11/13/2003,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"he is trying to imply that the only economy that has grown consistently over the past six years is facing fundamental problems   he is absolutely wrong. the reason we have managed to grow and others have failed to do so is, first, that we decided to make the bank of england independent; secondly, we set down monetary rules; thirdly, we went for a symmetrical inflation target, which the previous government refused to adopt; and fourthly, we have a medium-term fiscal strategy, which has shown that we can cut debt to a sustainable level and still secure the rises in public investment that are necessary while meeting our fiscal rules. the problem, however, is that on each of those policies the conservatives either oppose us or, alternatively, they wish to reverse the policy, as is the case with fiscal policy."
1405,12/4/2003,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,it is good that this country did not have to suffer from their policies over recent years. they refused to make the bank of england independent. they never supported our symmetrical inflation target until it was too late.
1406,12/4/2003,Conservative,conservative,Stephen Dorrell,"clearly, some aspects of the government's economic record should be welcomed, and i do so unreservedly. most important, establishing the independence of the bank of england and creating a regime for the effective management of monetary policy will, whatever happens between now and the day the government leave office, stand as a great achievement of this chancellor, and he should be given credit for that. he should be given credit, too, for restraining the growth of public expenditure in the early years of this labour government."
1407,12/4/2003,Labour,labour,Andrew Smith,"where this government are making tough choices for stability and progress, the opposition front bench propose extreme and muddled policies that would damage schools, hospitals and universities, abolish the new deal, drive up unemployment and threaten britain's hard-won economic stability.the opposition have not understood that our record on economic stability is the product of choices that we made and they opposed. they opposed the symmetrical inflation target and bank of england independence. they rubbished tough fiscal rules and would abolish the new deal."
1408,12/4/2003,Labour,labour,Andrew Smith,"the measures advance progress, fairness and a strong economy, and i commend them to the house. when in 1997 we made the bank of england independent, we also froze spending for two years, cut the national debt and imposed the responsibilities of the new deal   hard choices made to restore, as the central objective of british economic policy, the goal of high and stable levels of growth and employment.today, i can report to the house that british inflation has been at its lowest for 30 years; interest rates are their lowest since 1955; this christmas, there are more people in work in britain than at any time in our history; and economic growth in this country is now strengthening. while america, japan and half the euro area have suffered recessions, the british economy has   uniquely   grown uninterrupted, free of recession, in every single quarter in every single year since 1997."
1409,12/10/2003,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"with   since 1997   1 million more home owners in britain, rising household debt has been matched by rising household wealth and lower interest payments.because this government will never take stability for granted, i have announcements designed to entrench that stability. first, the credibility that has come from bank of england independence and the tough decisions to cut inflation have made possible a proactive, forward-looking approach to interest rates, cutting aggressively at the right time for the economy and, as the economy now strengthens, locking in long-term stability.the symmetrical inflation target enables the bank to be both pro-stability and pro-growth. the long-term credibility of our symmetrical target will be enhanced   as the independent office for national statistics reports in its paper published today   by adoption of the internationally recognised measure of inflation, the harmonised consumer prices index."
1410,12/10/2003,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"we will take no lectures about the cost of bureaucracy from the party that gave us the poll tax, bse and many other bureaucratic nightmares that we had to deal with when we came into government.when the records are looked at, it will be found that the shadow chancellor and his party have been wrong on every issue of economic policy. let us remember that they opposed bank of england independence, they opposed the minimum wage, they opposed the new deal, they opposed our symmetrical inflation target and they opposed our fiscal rules. today, they are opposing an economic policy that has given us the best growth for the past three years of all the g7 countries and a level of public investment in services that has been surpassed by no one in the last 50 years."
1411,12/10/2003,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"gentleman is saying that the stability pact should reflect the economic cycle, deal differently with countries with low debt than those with high debt, and take account of the needs of investment in our economy, i agree with him entirely   we have advanced that view to the european union. if he is inviting me to take his advice on every possible occasion, i should remind him that he objected to bank of england independence. he said that""it will make the efficient ."

1416,3/4/2004,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"he tries to lecture us on the economy, but i remind him that he and conservative members opposed the major decision that we made in 1997 to make the bank of england independent and create stability. the purpose of this budget is to lock in for great britain the economic stability that can and will endure.and it is a sign of the stability that britain has already achieved and a tribute to the dynamism and hard work of the british people that, even after the creation of 1.8 million jobs since 1997   1.3 million in the private sector   and over 100,000 extra businesses, today and every working day in our country, 600 new businesses are starting up, 25,000 men and women each and every day are finding new jobs, and an additional 10,000 new vacancies are each day being advertised, with new jobs being created at three times the rate of the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s.for decades after 1945, britain repeatedly relapsed into recession, moving from boom to bust. when i made that forecast a year ago, the leader of the opposition said that it was not just incautious and wrong but   i quote   ""a deliberate misrepresentation"" of britain's economic prospects, and said that not to meet it ""destroyed credibility"".i can report to the country that our growth in 2003 has indeed met our forecast."
1417,3/17/2004,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"the british economy grew in 2003 by 2.3 per cent.and it is because of bank of england independence, new fiscal rules, a symmetrical inflation target, the sanctions of the new deal, and the reduction of national debt   it is because britain had the strength to take these long-term decisions   that, over the last four years, while economic growth in germany has averaged less than 1 per cent., japan 1.4 per cent., italy 1.4 per cent., france 1.8 per cent., the euro area 1.6 per cent., the united states 2.4 per cent., growth here in britain in these years has averaged 2.5 per cent. and it is growth combined with, consistently, the lowest inflation for 30 years, the lowest interest rates for 40 years and the highest levels of employment in our history.in the past, britain has been first in, worst hit and last out of world recessions. all those things are positive."
1418,3/17/2004,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"however, the chancellor's finest hour came in his first week in office in 1997, when he made the bank of england independent. many of the problems now evident have been building up ever since. thirdly, patients must have the information on which to make informed choices if that dynamic is be reintroduced in the health service.the same applies to schools and elsewhere."
1419,3/17/2004,Conservative,conservative,Peter Lilley,"the government deserve some credit for not undermining the long-term benefits that began with the reforms of the 1980s, and for introducing improvements such as the independence of the bank of england and so on. however, they have started a policy of tax and spend that will undermine our relative advantage and, in due course, our economic performance. we may not want to believe that, but we will have to look at the classical economic rules governing free trade and the movement of capital because at the end of day democratic governments   we are seeing some of it in the united states   will have to protect the employment of their people, their electorate; they will have to try to preserve the tax base, which is becoming increasingly difficult; and they will also need to safeguard their public services.most hon."
1420,3/17/2004,Labour,labour,Denzil Davies,"members will not agree with me, but during the past 10 or 15 years i have seen democratic governments in britain and elsewhere transferring power over the economy to so-called independent or semi-independent bodies   for example, monetary power to central bankers. fiscal policy is very often entrenched in these rules, and i am glad that the chancellor has managed to stay within his own golden rule; and we have the rules of international trade as well. many labour members regretted that we stayed with that framework, as it did not help the economy."
1421,3/17/2004,Labour,labour,Stuart Bell,"what did help the economy, by reducing the inflation rate, was the independence of the bank of england, which the present chancellor brought about.the right hon. member for charnwood made a good point about freezing tax rates, but we know what the conservatives are building up to at the next general election.   to see the policies responsible for that stability, they should remember that they opposed every successful intervention in the economy by this government."
1422,3/17/2004,Labour,labour,Barry Gardiner,"that included independence for the bank of england and the dramatic introduction of the minimum wage. the opposition opposed those policies tooth and nail. and learned friend, we would not need to divide up his chancellorship   as so many of us do   between the first two or three years and the rest."
1423,3/17/2004,Conservative,conservative,Andrew Mitchell,"in the earlier period, his very sensible achievements included granting independence to the bank of england monetary policy committee to fix interest rates, controlling public expenditure and the degree of prudence   a word of which the chancellor remains fond   that he displayed. sadly, in the following three or four years, the position has been very different.i judge today's budget against the background of a business survey that i carried out in my constituency   as other hon. the chancellor has achieved that with two good decisions and two pieces of good luck."
1424,3/22/2004,Conservative,conservative,Peter Luff,"the first of the two good decisions was independence for the bank of england, which sent a powerful signal to the financial markets about his seriousness of purpose. the other decision, or rather non-decision, was not going into the single european currency   a wise course of action, and i hope that the chancellor continues to prevail in the argument with the prime minister on that.the chancellor has had a couple of bits of good luck, though. for over a year."
1425,3/23/2004,Labour,labour,Andrew Smith,"this change in britain's performance has not come about by accident, but because of the tough economic decisions that we have taken: making the bank of england independent, sticking to tough fiscal rules and introducing measures such as the sanctions of the new deal. those decisions have ensured that growth in britain over the past four years has been higher than that in japan, italy and the united states. i propose to do the same."
1426,3/23/2004,Liberal Democrat,Others,Steve Webb,"he begin by saying that""the chancellor's finest hour came in his first week in office in 1997, when he made the bank of england independent.""    [official report, 17 march 2004; vol. 419, c. the chancellor's neglect of the latter is, in my opinion, the cause of our problems today.monetary policy worked well since norman lamont's inflation target setting, and the chancellor has slightly improved the target."
1427,3/23/2004,Conservative,conservative,Kenneth Clarke,"the chancellor also reinforced it against all the political pressures from the social democrats around him in the government by making the bank of england independent and leaving it to carry on. at the moment, however, the chancellor is not making the task of the present governor of the bank of england very easy, because i am sure that the governor wants to set limits to how far he will have to put up interest rates, and that fiscal indiscipline will make the problems even worse.the chancellor has never had a consistent or sensible approach to fiscal policy   the tax and spending problems that he should tackle. the labour government have adopted a change in economic thinking, responded to the changing economy and begun to adopt new approaches."
1428,4/20/2004,Labour,labour,Doug Henderson,"the independence of the bank of england is an example of that. it would have been heresy for any labour member to argue for that in the early 1990s or before. it was recognised, however, that if we are to give markets more confidence   let us remember that markets are not just about capitalism, but about the workers, their expectations and their predictions   people must believe that macro-economic policy has been based on what the economy needs, not on what a political party needs."
1429,4/20/2004,Labour,labour,Doug Henderson,"when we give that degree of independence, while maintaining some influence over the long-term shape of the responsibilities of the bank of england, we nurture that improvement.on borrowing policy, one problem in the past was that, in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, many people still lived under the economics of the 1930s. in a less global economy, with massive deflation domestically, public expenditure programmes were necessary to create work. member for grantham and stamford, the government's fiscal policy has been one of the building blocks of the economic success and stability that they have achieved."
1430,4/20/2004,Labour,labour,Calum MacDonald,"the government are rightly given credit for their early decision to give the bank of england operational independence. that, too, has been an important building block, as hon. at the same time, a fair distribution of financial liabilities has been achieved between the generations."
1431,4/20/2004,Labour,labour,Nigel Beard,"disciplined fiscal policy has been complemented by the bank of england's independent conduct of monetary policy, which has given the financial system confidence that interest rates are fixed for economic reasons and not for political expediency. the consequence has been an unprecedented period of national prosperity, resulting in record low levels of inflation, interest and mortgage rates and unemployment, a stable economic climate that encourages businesses to invest and plan ahead and a resilience internationally that enabled the british economy to keep growing when the rest of the world moved into recession. this country's prosperity does depend on government policy, it will depend on it and it could be wrecked by the ideological folly of the conservative party."
1432,4/20/2004,Labour,labour,Nigel Beard,"after determined opposition, and some kicking and screaming, they have now accepted the bank of england's independent role in framing monetary policy.the dog that did not bark in the night is the conservatives' unwillingness to accept the chancellor's fiscal rules. they are within two years of a general election, but they will not say that they accept these rules or, indeed, any other rules. specific guidance was given to seek reductions in social housing numbers."
1433,5/5/2004,Labour,labour,David Wright,"that is no surprise, given the broad policy platform pursued by the conservatives during the 1980s and 1990s.on promoting affordable housing, the bravest decision that this government took was giving independence to the bank of england early in our time in office. that decision was crucial in terms of providing stability for owner-occupiers and for people in the broader housing market, and it gave the country confidence in interest rates. the barker review builds on that, envisaging a partnership between the treasury and the odpm in the development of housing policy."
1434,5/5/2004,Labour,labour,David Wright,"although the treasury has a key role to play in influencing the economy, giving independence to the bank of england was an important step in building public confidence.we remember the conservative years. between 1990 and 1997, nearly 500,000 homes were repossessed, and in 1992 1.2 million households were suffering from negative equity. i see that those on the conservative front bench have decided to offer their own analysis in place of kate barker's, and i am sure that the house will want to weigh in the balance the economic expertise of kate barker, a member of the bank of england's monetary policy committee, and the economic expertise of those on the conservative front bench today."
1435,5/5/2004,Labour,labour,Yvette Cooper,"they are, after all, the team whose leader argued strongly against giving the bank of england independence and said that it should not have increased interest rates in 1997 “98. given that those interest rates were so important in preventing the boom-bust cycle and in preventing a crash in the housing market like the one that we saw in the early '90s, i think economic history has demonstrated that we are lucky to be dependent on the judgment of the monetary policy committee in this area, rather than on that of the conservative front-bench team.the conservatives are kidding themselves if they think they can ignore the problems of house price inflation and pretend that there is no case for more houses to be built. the average interest rate under the conservative governments from 1979 to 1997 was 10.3 per cent., and interest rates have been less than half that under a labour government."
1436,6/17/2004,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"i seem to remember that when we made the bank of england independent, he said:""the decision to give the bank of england independence . . it makes absolutely no difference to the essential nature of the sovereignty of economic policy residing with us."
1437,6/21/2004,Labour,labour,Tony Blair,"look at the past few years: it is perfectly obvious that we decided, for example, to give the bank of england its independence and that we decided to pursue our own budget and fiscal policy. we are perfectly entitled to do so and we will carry on being entitled to do so. that is in place of a dictatorship that brutalised the people and ransacked the country."
1438,6/30/2004,Labour,labour,Tony Blair,"economically, iraq now has an open economy with an independent central bank, a real budgetary process, and a new and stable currency. a start has been made to rebuild iraq's hugely damaged and underinvested infrastructure   a process that will now continue under the guidance of the new iraqi government. gentleman from his wit and, indeed, from those on the treasury bench."
1439,7/5/2004,Conservative,conservative,Oliver Letwin,"i hope that i shall be able to provide him with sufficient armour plating in case he should meet the chancellor in the near future, because what he has suggested runs counter to the entire structure that the government established   rightly, i may say   when they established the independence of the bank of england. the whole point of that independence is that it acts as a check on undue extravagance or fiscal laxity on the part of the government, and it is acting in just that way now. the governor is not disobeying his remit; he is fulfilling it."
1440,7/5/2004,Conservative,conservative,Oliver Letwin,"he is doing what the chancellor of the exchequer asked him to do when the bank of england was made independent and an inflation target was established.i expect that the chancellor has frequently congratulated the governor on what he has done. i imagine that he has been sending messages to the governor over the past few weeks to thank him for his advice and to let him know just how grateful he is to the governor and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee for raising interest rates to counteract the effects of fiscal laxity in the pre-election spending spree that the government are wrongly engaging in. gentleman: i am not making a recommendation about monetary policy, because i believe in what he clearly does not."
1441,7/5/2004,Conservative,conservative,Oliver Letwin,"i believe in the structure that the chancellor himself established; i believe in the independence of the bank of england; and i believe it is right that decisions on monetary policy should be taken by a group of people removed from politics.my argument is very clear: the chancellor has created circumstances with his pre-election spree that are leading the bank of england to a certain set of responses, which it is trying to engage in very delicately, subtly and carefully precisely to avoid circumstances of the kind to which the hon. gentleman refers. he accurately diagnoses a real problem."
1442,7/5/2004,Conservative,conservative,Oliver Letwin,"the chancellor has set up the independence of the bank of england, and presumably believes in it, but he does not like it when the bank of england acts in the way that his remit asks it to. of course, he does not want to say that, because it would be a mite embarrassing to set something up and then, when it does the thing it has been asked to do, get explicitly cross about it.so, the chancellor sends his henchmen out to say, inexplicitly, that he is absolutely furious about it, in the hope that, somehow or other, this message will, by osmosis, reach the governor and that the governor will desist from saying and doing what in fact the chancellor has asked him to say and do. indeed, the governor offered congratulations not just on the chancellor's longevity, but on the""successful pursuit of economic stability   not even gladstone achieved such stability.""the cornerstone of that stability has been the monetary policy framework, which has delivered low and stable inflation."
1443,7/5/2004,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,"central to that have been the role of the monetary policy committee and the independence of the bank of england. but the right hon. member for west dorset, who has shared his views with us this evening, voted against the creation of the mpc, and was opposed to giving independence to the bank of england."
1444,7/5/2004,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,"as with a question of pronunciation   ""cecil"" or ""cicil""   a vote of opposition remains a vote of opposition, and that is what we got from the right hon. such concern is indeed what the opposition are expressing. in doing so, we are not being party political, for this is precisely the concern that the governor of the bank of england has expressed, as have many independent and largely left-leaning commentators.our concern is increased because of the government's complacency."
1445,7/5/2004,Conservative,conservative,John Gummer,"have they read their own alternative motion? when we introduced the symmetrical inflation target, the conservative party opposed it. when we made the bank of england independent, that was opposed by the right hon."
1446,7/12/2004,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"he should praise us on the conduct of economic management by the bank of england and on our fiscal policy, rather than criticising. as for his advice for the future, he advised us that we were wrong to make the bank of england independent, so i have been careful about taking his advice ever since. this debate is the second part of the budget."
1447,11/11/2004,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"he said:""the government   and gordon brown in particular   have established a reputation for maintaining economic stability. the independence of the bank of england has helped deliver steady growth, low unemployment and inflation.""why does the hon. gentleman not say in this house what he tells the cbi?"
1448,11/11/2004,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"this is the member of parliament who told us that if we made the bank of england independent, it would be an absolute disaster. it has proved to be one of the greatest success stories, so i am not sure that i should listen to his analysis of the five tests. i am very happy to engage in a comparison of records, and indeed on what we have delivered."
1449,11/23/2004,Labour,labour,Tony Blair,"over the past seven and a half years, bank of england independence, prudent economic management and the new deal have delivered the lowest interest rates, lowest inflation and lowest unemployment for decades. living standards of every section of the population are up. all of that was denied under the last conservative government; all of it delivered under this labour government."
1450,11/23/2004,Labour,labour,Tony Blair,"let us never forget, indeed, that every penny piece of that investment, every economic measure, such as bank of england independence, and every attempt at fairness, such as the minimum wage, was opposed by the right hon. and learned member for folkestone and hythe and the conservative party.the queen's speech therefore builds on our record. it is a labour success story."
1451,11/29/2004,Labour,labour,Stephen Byers,"in 1997, early in office, we took the difficult decisions to give independence to the bank of england and to stick to the two-year spending limits that we inherited from the conservative government   criticised by many people at the time   and because we have economic stability, we have record levels of people in work and low interest rates, and inflation is under control. that is the first part of the foundations that we need for an opportunity society.secondly, we need security in our homes, in our streets and at our borders. it is because we refused to adopt his policies that we have a good record."
1452,12/1/2004,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"when we froze spending in the first two years of the labour government, the last conservative chancellor said that he would never have gone through with it.as for the independence of the bank of england, i hope that the shadow chancellor will have the good grace to apologise to the house because on 11 november 1997 he voted against the second reading of the bill to grant it independence. not only did he vote against it, but so did the current leader of the opposition, who said:""the new labour government is taking action which i believe is going to damage the future of this country.""that was not a party that wanted to give the impression, either in private or in public, that it supported the major decision on monetary policy that was taken by labour.i am glad that the shadow deregulation minister has returned to the shadow cabinet so that it has a more moderate image and looks more centrist, and therefore appeals to the middle ground. millions of voters in this country who have not yet decided whether to vote, and if they do, for which party, are tired of the tedium of the most tribal politics."
1453,12/1/2004,Conservative,conservative,John Bercow,"therefore, let me say straight away that i concede that the chancellor was right and we were wrong about independence for the bank of england; that was one of the best decisions that he has made. does he, in turn, accept the verdict of a countless number of my constituents and that of my right hon. before talking about opportunity, i congratulate the chancellor on his economic record and the achievement of economic stability, which underpins all our subsequent policies as a government and gives us the chance at long last to invest in and reform our sorely neglected public services, ensuring that we can create a fairer society with opportunity for many people who were left behind in the years of conservative government."
1454,12/1/2004,Labour,labour,Angela Eagle,"that economic stability has been achieved through political choices about, for example, the independence of the bank of england and monetary policy, as well as a system of fiscal rules that have enabled us to steer a steady course through internationally choppy waters.whatever the opposition's motivation in attempting to paint a different picture, the economic facts are unchallengeable and need to be put on the record. we have had growth in every quarter for the past seven years, thus achieving the longest period of continuous growth for 200 years. letwin), the shadow chancellor, has been a long-time advocate of independence for the bank of england setting interest rates   it was fascinating stuff."
1455,12/1/2004,Labour,labour,Alan Johnson,"he presumably argued the case at dinner parties all over north or south london, and perhaps he grabbed strangers on long train journeys to tell them that it was the thing to do. when he entered the house as a member of parliament and went through the lobby, however, he voted against independence for the bank of england.the chancellor ate the shadow chancellor alive, but left a little bit over for cold sandwiches tomorrow. at the core of this pre-budget report is the belief that the britain of long-term economic strength will be the britain that at a time of rapid economic change and uncertainty locks in our economic stability for the long-term; the britain that, as by 2015 asia acquires a growing share of low-cost production, resolves to invest in high-value-added, high-technology manufacturing and services, and achieves world leadership in science and technology; and the britain that, with enterprise and high-skilled jobs now the key to long-term prosperity, takes the tough decisions to achieve american levels of business creation and has, at every level, the best educated and most flexible work force in the world."
1456,1/19/2005,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,"that is the product not of chance or good fortune, but of the tough decisions for the long term that we have taken since we took office in 1997. the first of those decisions, which the opposition never had the political courage to implement, was the independence of the bank of england and our fiscal rules. the conservatives opposed both."
1457,1/19/2005,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,"i understand that they have recanted on the former and now support the independence of the bank of england, while having the bare-faced cheek to lecture us about decisions taken in the phase of the political, as opposed to the economic, cycle, as my hon. friend the member for warrington, south (helen southworth) pointed out sotto voce when the hon. member for tatton made that bizarre assertion.the hon."
1458,1/19/2005,Labour,labour,Paul Boateng,"gentleman will no doubt tell us that he has always supported the independence of the bank of england. i fancy that examination of his record shows no such thing. i hope, for the sake of the conservative party front-bench spokesmen, that there is the detail behind that powerpoint presentation that a work of that kind requires."
1459,1/19/2005,Labour,labour,Stephen Timms,"we gathered from the front-bench spokesman that the conservative party will not publish that detail, and, indeed, callers to conservative central office on monday were told that it would not do so because that would give too much ammunition to the party's critics, which is probably absolutely correct.independence for the bank of england, the symmetric inflation target, the golden rule, the sustainable investment rule    i might listen to the hon. gentleman if he had ever got anything right."
1460,2/3/2005,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,he was completely wrong when he opposed the independence of the bank of england and he is completely wrong again. britain is today experiencing the longest period of sustained economic growth since records began in 1701. it is the least volatile and most stable of all the major industrialised economies.
1461,3/16/2005,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"and with bank of england independence and continued wage discipline, i can report that inflation is today just 1.6 per cent. we expect it to be just 1Â¾ per cent this year, 2 per cent. we are generally doing well."
1462,3/16/2005,Liberal Democrat,Others,Charles Kennedy,"of course part of the reason for that, on which i know the chancellor now agrees, is that when he first came to his high office, he implemented liberal democrat policy on giving operational independence to the bank of england. the difference between the chancellor and ourselves, of course, was that he did not say it and he did it, whereas we said it and would have done it had we been given the opportunity to do so.the chancellor rightly speaks about the need for social justice in our country and for our tax and expenditure policies to reflect that ambition. my constituents are pleased about that, naturally   everyone should be pleased about it   but it would be sensible for hon."
1463,3/16/2005,Conservative,conservative,Quentin Davies,"members to ask again what lies behind it, how it has been achieved and whether it is sustainable.there is no question but that the economy's stability, as shown in a low and pretty stable inflation rate, is largely the result of turning over the management of the monetary side of our economy to an independent bank of england   or rather, to the monetary policy committee   a policy of which i was always in favour and for which i argued consistently in the 1990s. when the new government came to power, i refused to join my front-bench colleagues in voting against that measure, because i thought it absolutely right.i am glad that the government did that. member for fylde talked about confetti, but the reality is that although every change in the budget, if considered in isolation, might not mean a lot to all of us in here, each one will have a meaningful effect on the lives of the people we represent."
1464,3/16/2005,Labour,labour,Helen Liddell,"it is the sum of the parts that makes the difference.this has not been talked about much this afternoon, but i believe that when the chancellor took the decision on that first weekend in government in 1997 to give operational independence to the bank of england, achieving the climate that was to reduce interest rates and allow more and more people to become home owners and more and more people to set up businesses, a fundamental change was made to this economy. we shall reap the benefits for years to come.i believe that the government have achieved a lot and i am delighted to have had an opportunity to play some part in that. i think we all agree that it started brilliantly."
1465,3/16/2005,Conservative,conservative,John Horam,"conservative members have conceded that the new chancellor's first steps were excellently judged   the independence of the bank of england, for instance, which could be described as outsourcing. it always amuses me when labour members rebel against outsourcing or criticise it, as they often do. there is a long tradition of the government adopting liberal democrat policy."
1466,3/17/2005,Liberal Democrat,Others,John Thurso,"it began   let me get this out of the way   in 1997, when in his first announcement the chancellor said that he was giving independence to the bank of england   a policy that had been in our manifesto for that election and upon which we had fought, and on which there was not a word in the labour party's manifesto. it was an extremely sound move and one that we were happily able to applaud. gentleman is standing down at the general election; it was a great privilege for me to serve under his excellent chairmanship of the select committee on trade and industry in the last parliament.given the growth rates of which the hon."
1467,3/17/2005,Conservative,conservative,John Bercow,"gentleman is inordinately proud and the point that we have reached in the economic cycle, does not he think that it is a matter for concern that the government are sharply overshooting on public borrowing, and that that is all the more serious in light of the chancellor's worst policy decision, his best being the independence of the bank of england   the decimation of the british savings industry? it is a pleasure and privilege to follow the hon. it is right that we should give the right hon."
1468,3/17/2005,Conservative,conservative,Francis Maude,"gentleman full credit for the decision to make the bank of england independent. that move was overdue and, with hindsight, we should have done it a long time ago. it genuinely is a vote now, pay later budget, and it is about time the chancellor was more honest about that.there is one thing that the government did right, and they will be remembered for it."
1469,3/17/2005,Conservative,conservative,Peter Luff,"when the history of the government is written, as it will be in a few weeks, it will become clear that the independence of the bank of england was the defining moment. by that one move the chancellor of the exchequer succeeded in   to use his words   locking in the legacy that he had inherited. many other budget assumptions are independently audited by the national audit office, and i think that this particular assumption should be measured independently, although i make no judgment as to whether the nao is the right body to do it.there is already some dispute about when the cycle is ending."
1470,3/17/2005,Conservative,conservative,Michael Fallon,"the bank of england clearly believes that it is ending a little earlier than the chancellor thinks, and the matter should be established definitively and independently.secondly, there is now a great deal of evidence that the rule itself is being fudged. i was suspicious right back in the early days, when we suddenly saw some money for nurses' training lifted out of the community fund. he mentioned the school starting age and bribing people to stay on at school, as he put it, which prompted a learned debate about academic evidence on the value of playtime in scandinavia."
1471,3/17/2005,Conservative,conservative,Andrew Tyrie,"i do not know the answer to the question   i am just not qualified to comment   but i noted what was said.i acknowledge the success of the uk economy in recent years and agree that the chancellor has taken one or two good decisions, such as giving the bank of england full independence, which i had long supported in principle. i regret that the chancellor cannot bring himself to give credit where credit is due. gentleman for pointing out that any increases in public spending in the future, under this or any other government, will depend on the state of the economy."
1472,3/21/2005,Conservative,conservative,Tim Collins,"i must tell him, however, that the turnaround in the economy occurred considerably before 1997, and that the longest period of economic growth since records began   to which the chancellor seems always to refer   started considerably before 1997.all of us   members in all parts of the house   accept that one decision by the government for which they do deserve a great deal of credit, in the context of the present state of the economy, is the decision to make the   bank of england independent. gentleman will join in the joy and delight being expressed throughout the house that one party is still committed to an independent bank of england   the conservative party. all the others want to put it under the control of the european central bank."
1473,3/21/2005,Labour,labour,Iain Wright,"several factors have produced that stability. first and foremost was the decision taken in the first few days of the labour administration in 1997 to make the bank of england independent. i do not wish to make petty party political points, much as i am tempted to."
1474,3/21/2005,Labour,labour,Iain Wright,"the conservative government of the 1980s decimated economic activity in hartlepool and did that again in the early 1990s, so i would rather not have lessons in economic management and competence from the conservative party. the fact remains that only a labour administration were bold enough to give the bank of england independence, which was an important building block in helping to produce a stable and prudent economy.a second key factor that is often grossly overlooked is the decision taken in 1997 to repay a substantial amount of the national debt. the figures provided by the chancellor in his ""financial statement and budget report"" last week were impressive."
1475,3/21/2005,Labour (Co-op),labour,Andrew Love,"by 2006. of course, the fact that that is the lowest figure for 30 years endorses the decision taken very early on by this government to make the bank of england independent. that decision has also resulted in the lowest interest rates for 35 years, from which this country's 18 million home owners have directly benefited.growth   the usual measure of economic success   was 3.1 per cent."

1478,3/22/2005,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"that is an advantage, and it is probably a product   in part, at least   of good policy decisions on the independence of the bank of england.as i advocated the policy of changing the stamp duty thresholds, i cannot help but agree with the chancellor's proposal to do so. i am a bit disappointed that he did not go up to Â£150,000, because Â£120,000 is of precious little use in london and the south-east of england. fall in the rate of unemployment."

1480,5/17/2005,Conservative,conservative,Andrew Robathan,"i was ambivalent at the time, but i applaud the chancellor's decision eight years ago to give independence to the bank of england. whatever we say, there are improvements in hospitals. he was harsh on the prime minister and i certainly share his harsh analysis of the prime minister's record."
1481,5/18/2005,Conservative,conservative,Peter Luff,"however, he perhaps missed one thing that i rather wish that he had done as chancellor of the exchequer: independence of the bank of england. the government might just be remembered for that; it is perhaps their sole claim for a place in the history books of the united kingdom.it was a pleasure to hear the speech made by the hon. the government talk about taking measures to address the pensions crisis   a crisis of their own creation."
1482,5/18/2005,Conservative,conservative,Peter Luff,"perhaps if the bank of england's independence is this government's greatest achievement, its worst legacy is the crisis in pensions. what about prosperity? in short, britain has never worked so productively, created so much wealth and generated so many jobs as in today's enterprising and innovative economy.all that has not happened through serendipity."
1483,5/19/2005,Labour,labour,Alan Johnson,"it has happened because our workers and businesses have excelled within a supportive economic framework set by this government, including an independent bank of england, tough fiscal rules and help for those outside the labour market through the new deal. as a result, britain has become one of the most favourable environments for starting and growing a business. i am willing to acknowledge that the british economy has enjoyed 51 quarters of continuous growth if he is willing to acknowledge that by the time he entered office, 19 of them had already happened."
1484,5/25/2005,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"i am willing to accept that giving the bank of england independence was the right thing to do, if he is ready to accept the recent bank of england report that says that the current period of remarkable stability began five years before labour came to power.i am happy to recognise the value of his golden rule, if he is happy to recognise that it is undermined because the chancellor is his own judge and jury on that rule. whatever happened to the panel of independent forecasters that would decide whether the golden rule had been met? as for the shadow chancellor himself, it may be too early to judge, but it may be time for the conservative party to skip yet another generation.the queen's speech reaffirms our fundamental and first priority as a government: economic stability."
1485,5/25/2005,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"even amidst a succession of economic challenges since 1997, including the american downturn and the doubling of oil prices, and now facing the challenges, acknowledged by the shadow chancellor, of chinese and asian competition, changing technology and current account imbalances, our measures, such as bank of england independence   opposed, by the way, by conservative members   our symmetrical inflation target, opposed by conservative members, our fiscal rules, opposed by conservative members, and the new deal, opposed by conservative members, have helped achieve years of continuous growth for this country.our stability is for a purpose: to ensure businesses are able to invest and that home owners have a fair deal. that is because all of us   i believe that this is true of members in all sections of the house   were struck during the election campaign by how many more young people, couples especially but also single people, now want to buy their first home but need, even with our low interest rates and the stamp duty changes that we made, further help to get on to the first rung of the housing ladder. the new deal has cut youth unemployment from a peak of 3,300 young people out of work in 1984 to just 130 today   20 in my constituency."

1487,5/26/2005,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"gentleman to his new post, but perhaps he might withdraw the allegation that he made.as for the conservative party's proposal, which it never put into practice when in government, that all public finances be submitted to an independent committee, rather like the monetary policy committee of the bank of england, i do say   this is the argument that the conservatives use in relation to the european union   that the final decisions on public finances, and therefore on taxation, in this country have always historically been made by this house of commons; and the government answer to this house of commons, so i do not believe that an independent committee doing that is the way forward for this country. if the tories do not believe in it for europe, they should not believe in it for britain either. as ireland to the west has shown, however, it is possible to benefit what were once considered to be the political and economic fringes, as long as we are not all stuck with the ""one size fits all"" economic politics of the sterling zone."
1488,5/26/2005,Scottish National Party,Others,Angus MacNeil,"irish independence has been an economic win-win situation for both the united kingdom and ireland, as has norway's independence for norway and sweden.the sentiments of the former governor of the bank of england make me proud as punch to be a member of the scottish national party and to be here today   although that is tempered by the fact that on my first day i was taken to westminster hall and reminded of the fate of an earlier scottish nationalist in these parts, william wallace, who was hanged, drawn and quartered for his politics 700 years ago this august. i am not sure that i can match that courage; in fact, i am certain that i cannot   just in case some members are getting ideas.in 1900, there were about 50 independent nations on earth. i will try to be a little more focused on the finance bill itself but, since he has given us the invitation to talk about macro-economics, i should pay tribute to the government, as there is no doubt that their track record on macro-economic stability is a very good one."
1489,6/7/2005,Liberal Democrat,Others,Christopher Huhne,"we are all in favour of macro-economic stability, which has been the happy result of the chancellor's granting of independence to the bank of england and of the framework for fiscal policy that has been pursued, including the golden rule.as for the economic record, it is worth pointing out, before ministers allow hyperbole to get the better of them, that their record is good but not as stellar as is usually claimed. in fact, no fewer than six of the other old european union countries have grown on average more rapidly since 1997. the first is the national audit office, where a structure exists to provide advice to the house through the comptroller and auditor general and the institution of the public accounts committee."
1490,6/7/2005,Conservative,conservative,Stephen Dorrell,"we could establish a similar organisation to provide to the house an independent view of the likely course of the public finances.the second parallel is the claim that is often   in my view, rightly   made by the government that they improved the quality of macro-economic decision making by making the bank of england independently responsible for monetary policy. i am not in favour of taking the fundamental budget judgments away from the chancellor. stuart), i believe that a number of the government's economic decisions have been correct and could not be opposed by anyone."
1491,6/7/2005,Conservative,conservative,Theresa Villiers,"the government have displayed a degree of common sense, most notably in giving independence to the bank of england. however much we might debate aspects of the government's record, one thing seems clear to me. clause 7 contains a sweeping description of the powers of the secretary of state."
1492,6/14/2005,Liberal Democrat,Others,Martin Horwood,the government took our advice soon after they came to power by allowing more independence to the bank of england. the chancellor has found it useful to have that political file between him and the decision makers of the monetary policy committee. gentleman's proposal.
1493,7/6/2005,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"in the case of the bank of england, we decided that independence was the right thing. in the end, with the support of opposition members   it took a little time   we decided that it was right to hand over the power to take month-by-month interest rate decisions to a group of independent experts. friend the chancellor outlined in his budget back in march, the government's economic objective is to build a strong economy and a fair society, in which there is opportunity and security for all."
1494,7/6/2005,Labour,labour,Dawn Primarolo,"the long-term decisions that the government have taken   giving independence to the bank of england, new fiscal rules and a reduction in debt   have helped to shape economic stability, which in turn has created the platform for building prosperity, achieving social justice with security and opportunity for all, and maintaining investment in public services. this bill contains measures to strengthen further stability while sustaining enterprise and ensuring fairness.i have made this point to the house before and i will do so again because i believe it goes to the heart of this bill: a fair tax system is one in which everyone pays their fair share. charles clover reported what was said to be the right hon."
1495,10/12/2005,Labour,labour,Margaret Beckett,"gentleman's view that""an independent body, like the bank of england""   this takes us back to a point made in an earlier intervention on the right hon. gentleman   ""should preside over the transition to a low carbon economy"",which should be achieved through a 3 per cent. per year cut in emissions."
1496,10/12/2005,Labour,labour,Margaret Beckett,"but although the bank of england's independent role in the economy is crucial, it is specific and limited. it sets the level of interest rates, so what would this new body control and how would it control it? gentleman, who was wrong about the bank of england's independence, should congratulate the government on the stability that we maintain and are determined to continue to maintain, with low inflation, low interest rates and rising employment in our economy."
1497,10/19/2005,Labour,labour,Tony Blair,"without going back over all the statistics that we have been trading on the economic performance of his government compared with ours, i am not sure whether the right hon. we all know that the last conservative government was a disaster in terms of boom-and-bust economics and that this government have produced economic stability. incidentally, when we are talking about reform, this chancellor introduced one very important reform, bank of england independence, which played an important part in giving this country stability, and i remind the right hon."
1498,10/19/2005,Labour,labour,Tony Blair,"and learned gentleman that he opposed it. it is true that there have been small increases in the unemployment claimant count, but employment has continued to rise and unemployment is way down on a few years ago.the right hon. and learned gentleman has said that we agree about bank of england independence."
1499,10/19/2005,Labour,labour,Tony Blair,i must point out that he did not agree at the time and that he opposed it. this is a chancellor who is holding britain back. there are some members of the conservative party who remain to be convinced about making the bank of england independent.
1500,12/8/2005,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,i should tell the house that the hon. gentleman has been consistent in his opposition to bank of england independence. he said that it would make the efficient macro-economic management of our affairs more difficult and then predicted that it would lead to higher levels of unemployment.
1501,12/8/2005,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,unemployment has gone down by half a million since we came to power and there are 2.3 million more jobs. he should be admitting that he was wrong on the matter and that it was right to make the bank of england independent. the answer is no.
1502,1/26/2006,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"as for the hon. gentleman's advice on economic policy, i would have thought more of it had he supported the independence of the bank of england. ""complacent"" will be quite sufficient to support my disappointment."
1503,1/26/2006,Labour,labour,Des Browne,"it did not seem to me that, in a factual question, there was room even for his extravagant expressions of regret.the hon. gentleman has expressed judgment on whether the steps that the government have taken were appropriate, and he will recollect that he was one of the    most vociferous and consistent critics of the government's decision in the early days to give the bank of england independence. he may well, like most of his colleagues on the conservative benches, have changed his view on that, and now has to accept the judgment made by the government."
1504,2/16/2006,Conservative,conservative,Philip Dunne,"i do not criticise this government particularly because all governments have a tendency to change the rules as they go along, so whatever regulatory oversight regime is in place, there should be an element of independence. just as, to their credit, the government introduced independence for the bank of england, they should consider a regulatory oversight regime for the national pension savings scheme that is independent of government. i accept what my hon."
1505,3/2/2006,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"friend says, and i understand that the conservative leader has now reached the conclusion that stability is the foundation of what should be done. since 1997, we have been consistent in supporting stability as the foundation of policy and that required us, in the first instance, to take the difficult decision of making the bank of england independent   a decision opposed by the conservatives. it is a great honour and privilege to deliver a 10th budget."
1506,3/22/2006,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"last year, our stability enabled us for the first time in a generation to issue bonds with maturities of up to 50 years. i can announce that in the next issue, long-dated gilts will increase from just under half to just under two thirds, reflecting the benefits we now gain as a country from long-term stability.today, i am also publishing the detailed proposals, modelled on bank of england independence, for official statistics to be the responsibility of an independent board, and for enhanced accountability to parliament.i am also publishing today the new memorandum of understanding between the treasury, the bank of england and the financial services authority so that britain has in place the most up-to-date early warning and response system to deal with any risk to financial stability.we will continue to be vigilant over global imbalances and oil prices.we will take no risks with inflation at home. the public sector pay settlements will show settlements this year averaging just 2Â¼ per cent., combining fairness in pay, with more for nurses, with vigilance and discipline in the fight against inflation.it is britain's new economic stability, and also our commitment to free trade, open markets and scientific progress, and our willingness to invest, that make our country better placed than ever to be one of the global economy's success stories."
1507,3/22/2006,Liberal Democrat,Others,Menzies Campbell,"in spite of what the right hon. gentleman has said today, there is complacency about the threat to the environment, and he presides over a treasury that cannot manage even its own tax credit system.of course we welcome the changes in child tax credit and acknowledge the stability in inflation and employment, but we are entitled to remind the chancellor that that stability is based on the independence of the bank of england. clarke).i congratulate the chancellor, as i have done every year since he has been chancellor, on his decision to grant independence to the bank of england."
1508,3/23/2006,Conservative,conservative,Nicholas Soames,"this time, i applaud very much the steps that the government have taken, although belatedly, to assign more independence to the office for national statistics. member for edinburgh, north and leith (mark lazarowicz), but sadly, i cannot. looking back at the 10 budgets presented by this chancellor of the exchequer, the step on which to congratulate him is his granting independence to the bank of england."
1509,3/23/2006,Conservative,conservative,Graham Stuart,"indeed, it is a pleasure to have here today the hon. we can trade statistics, but does the hon. gentleman agree that, in retrospect, it was a mistake for the conservative party to vote against bank of england independence in 1997?"
1510,3/23/2006,Conservative,conservative,Graham Stuart,"i entirely and happily agree that the independence of the bank of england was a good thing. however, the hon. stuart) may remember that in the six months before the change of government, the then chancellor of the exchequer had constantly ignored advice from the governor of the bank of england that interest rates needed to rise."
1511,3/23/2006,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,the change of government and bank of england independence actually restored stability to an overheating and dangerously inflationary economy. can the hon. member for tatton (mr.
1512,3/28/2006,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"  osborne) confirm that he proposed to undermine the independence of the bank of england and of the governor by making bank of england executives a minority on the monetary policy committee? why would he undermine the governor of the bank of england? i support bank of england independence and, like the chancellor, i am looking at ways to entrench it still further."
1513,3/28/2006,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"i enjoyed the new statesman interview with the hon. i have to take the blame for that, as that was my education, and i am responsible for it, but i would sooner get the words wrong than get my judgment wrong. after all, he was the leader who slammed bank of england independence, who claimed that the minimum wage was the height of irresponsibility and would cause unemployment, and who said that lord archer was a man of integrity."
1514,3/29/2006,Labour,labour,John Prescott,"if there is a choice between getting my words wrong and getting my judgment wrong, i would sooner have my problem than his. whatever the actual impact of the measure, it is clear that the changes will not create clarity and simplicity to help the public's ability to understand their effect on them. perhaps, as was the case for self-invested personal pensions last year, a lack of planning will result in significant unintentional consequences and might yet force embarrassing compromises from the government.to sum up, while the government's macro-economic record to date has largely been one of stability, one of the fundamental reasons why that has been the case was that the bank of england was given independence   that policy was called for by the liberal democrats."
1515,4/24/2006,Liberal Democrat,Others,Julia Goldsworthy,"however, the government tend to spoil their own narrative with endless hype and exaggeration, which becomes easier when they are responsible for marking their own exam papers when analysing their economic record.the hallmark of the chancellor's time in the treasury has been vast over-complication and endless meddling with minutiae. that must be uncomfortable information for him. if i had taken his advice, i would not have made the bank of england independent, which would have been a terrible mistake, so i shall think twice before taking his advice on anything."
1516,6/27/2006,Conservative,conservative,John Penrose,"i should like to pick up some comments made by the hon. member for birkenhead. i am not signing up to all his proposals, but one of his ideas is to have an independent board of trustees, which he models on the governors of the bank of england, that is at arm's length from the government, that is independent and that is charged with commenting on and maintaining the consensus and the settlement that has been established today."
1517,6/27/2006,Conservative,conservative,John Penrose,"we could build that into the role of the trustees for the npss. our task now is to address that issue and to seek to take the political instability out of the system. just as bank of england independence has made it easier for companies to invest, so a consensus on the future of pension policy will make it easier for workers to save."
1518,6/27/2006,Labour,labour,James Purnell,"that is why the government called today's debate and tabled a substantive motion. why can the procedure not be more open and transparent? is it appropriate, in a bank of england that the chancellor claims he has made independent, that those appointments should be made by him in such a personal way?"
1519,7/13/2006,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"let us remind the house that the hon. gentleman was a vicious opponent of the independence of the bank of england. he said that it would lead to deflationary policies and higher unemployment, and that the bank of england's reputation would be damaged."
1520,7/13/2006,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"there is market sensitivity, so such appointments must be handled with care. well, if we had followed the opposition's policy, the bank of england would not have been independent, we would not have had stability, we would not have had low inflation, and we would not have had the lowest interest rates for 30 years. the effect of independence for the bank of england and the accompany monetary and fiscal policy is that inflation, interest rates and mortgage rates have been half what they were in the previous 18 years."
1521,7/13/2006,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"i have considered all kinds of proposals that have been put forward for reform of the bank of england monetary policy committee. i echo the sympathy expressed by the chancellor over the sad death of david walton. the independence of the bank of england was called for and welcomed by the liberal democrats, but does the chancellor agree that it is compromised by the direct control that he exercises in appointments?"
1522,7/13/2006,Liberal Democrat,Others,Julia Goldsworthy,is he prepared to give up that control and fall into line with the code relating to ministerial appointments? i remind the hon. lady that the conservative party opposed the legislation for independence of the bank of england.
1523,7/13/2006,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,she says that she supported that legislation    target for 2050 on which we all agree. it would also establish an independent body to monitor the science of climate change and make recommendations in much the same way that the monetary policy committee of the bank of england does.
1524,10/12/2006,Conservative,conservative,Peter Ainsworth," [ interruption] indeed, as the secretary of state notes from a sedentary position, we need a decision-making body, not just one capable of recommendations   not decisions over policy but over the trajectory and the direction of travel and what we need to do to meet the threat. i do agree, and there are similar examples all around the country. the most important thing driving that job creation and new investment has been the stability in our economy since 1997   stability through bank of england independence and through our fiscal rules."
1525,10/26/2006,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"that stability would be put at risk if we were to return to the old days of unfunded and uncosted tax cuts for a few, which would be paid for by higher interest rates and instability, hitting families all around our country. of the whole economy and dwarfing the traditional industries of mining, shipbuilding and even whisky. does he agree that an independent bank of england and a single regulatory authority have served the interests of scotland well and that the only guarantee of a prosperous scotland is a vote for the union?"
1526,11/16/2006,Conservative,conservative,Michael Fallon,"i remind the house of my interests recorded in the register of members' interests.i congratulate the hon. we need a deep debate about that to come up with the right answers so that we are not tied down by an unhelpful bureaucracy; we need one that helps us in the process towards the ends we all want to achieve.a related point is the role of the carbon committee. at the weekend, some commentators suggested that the committee should be made independent, like the bank of england."
1527,11/20/2006,Labour (Co-op),labour,Linda Gilroy,"we could draw on that experience to some extent, but we should also look at the role played by the low pay commission in helping us to bring the minimum wage on stream, without all the repercussions that the opposition warned about, such as the high level of unemployment that did not happen. we must do so by entrenching our stability. that is why the statistics bill will continue the process that we started with the bank of england and the competition authorities, and continued with industrial policy   the process of making policy independent of government."
1528,11/27/2006,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"we will out-innovate our competitors if we pursue the science, technology and skills strategy that we are putting forward.we must meet the environmental challenge by taking action on climate change, hence the climate change bill that we will discuss in the house. what if i had taken the advice of the former chancellor at any point during the last 10 years? in 1998, he was predicting a recession and he opposed giving independence to the bank of england."
1529,12/6/2006,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"in his column on 21 june 1998, he wrote:""i have been forecasting doom and gloom for the british economy in my column in the financial mail for most of the past year"".that was the first of 10 years of stable growth in our economy. friend examines the detailed proposals, he will see that the principal part of the system is not about the publication of data, which he is talking about, but the assessment and standards relating to that publication. he is right to point out that this is indeed the next step in the chancellor's reforms of the machinery of economic governance     [interruption.] if i can finish my sentence, i shall add that the new system is based on the approach adopted by the government towards the independence of the bank of england, the setting up of the competition commission and the financial services authority   all moves in which formal devolution of ministerial power was accorded to credible, independent institutions with a clear remit set by parliament and the government."
1530,1/8/2007,Labour,labour,John Healey,"that is very much the approach that we are adopting in the bill. he said that it was a formula for lack of trust, because anybody who looks can see that the minister has decided that particular things do not go anywhere near the ons. charles bean, chief economist at the bank of england, expressed concern that retaining a ministerial veto over which figures could be treated as national statistics appeared""to run against the broad thrust of the proposals""to make statistics more independent of the government."
1531,1/8/2007,Conservative,conservative,Michael Fallon,"i do not want to test the patience of the house, but i will give it one more try. friend the financial secretary said, the bill is historic. it is the next stage in what has been a radical programme of reform of the institutions of british economic policy since 1997: the independence of the bank of england, the new, statutory financial services authority, the debt management office, the code of fiscal stability and the independence of the competition authorities.for each of those reforms, we put in legislation a requirement for clear and unambiguous objectives and a proper division of responsibilities, with case-by-case decisions being taken at arm's length from ministers, but having proper ministerial and parliamentary accountability and maximum transparency and scrutiny."
1532,1/8/2007,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"the reforms of the statistical system that we put forward today are firmly in that tradition. member for chipping barnet began her speech by pointing out that she would support the bill, saying that it was a step in the right direction, yet then tried to claim that trust in statistics was at an all-time low and that issues of transparency, honesty and public trust were matters for the government. however, i have to tell her that it was the labour government, not the last conservative government, who made the bank of england independent."
1533,1/8/2007,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,in 1997 there was no code for fiscal stability. and my hon. friend is absolutely right: the conservative party opposed the independence of the bank of england.
1534,1/25/2007,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"i look forward to continuing interventions from the hon. if i had taken the hon. gentleman's advice, which he gave me very forcefully   indeed, even more forcefully in 1997   i would not have made the bank of england independent; he said that that would lead to deflation, unemployment and ruin for the british economy."
1535,1/25/2007,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"the opposite has happened. it is undoubtedly true that the very dramatic increases in public expenditure have increased the inflationary pressures in the economy as well. since the chancellor has twice today reminded the house that we had reservations about the independence of the bank of england, may i remind him that we had reservations about the proposals that he tabled in the bank of england bill because the bank would not be independent enough?"
1536,1/25/2007,Conservative,conservative,Bernard Jenkin,"  [interruption.] oh yes, it is true. of course a contract for jobs in this country in an industry in which we have expertise involving a large employer with a good reputation is potentially beneficial   of course a contract with an ally, whatever its failings, is potentially beneficial. however, from the beginning there was independent evidence   the bank of england is as good a witness to call as any   that this was not an unqualified bonus: that it was not thought to be an unarguably beneficial contract."
1537,2/7/2007,Liberal Democrat,Others,Simon Hughes,"at the end of this exercise, only time will tell and only full information being revealed will show us whether the national interest has, on balance, been served by the contract, which began back in the 1980s.nobody on the liberal democrat benches has ever argued that   where we can do so legitimately and properly, at home or abroad   we should not seek work and contracts for british companies. i call on the government and the minister for the middle east to indicate that they will turn the planned anti-bribery bill into a reality, so that we can have a new anti-bribery act. i think what was also said was that we all remember, as an example of change, that it was our party that introduced bank of england independence, opposed by the right hon."
1538,2/21/2007,Labour,labour,Tony Blair,"gentleman; it was our party that introduced the minimum wage, opposed by him; and it was our party that introduced record investment in schools and hospitals, opposed by him. central to my right hon. friend's economic success was giving independence to the bank of england."
1539,3/1/2007,Labour,labour,Jim Devine,"can the bank of england set interest rates for foreign countries? friend the member for twickenham said in committee, the point behind our amendments is not treasury-bashing. we have always made it clear that the treasury has taken some very important decisions that have signalled a willingness to give independence to important institutions such as the bank of england."
1540,3/13/2007,Liberal Democrat,Others,Julia Goldsworthy,"indeed, perhaps that is what is disappointing about this provision. the new statistics system set out in the bill will help us to achieve both. it can evolve in the light of new, shifting statistical demands and experience, and it is the next step in the chancellor's reform of the machinery of economic governance, which began in 1997 with the statutory independence of the bank of england, followed by independence for the competition commission and the financial services authority."
1541,3/13/2007,Labour,labour,John Healey,"each reform, like the reform in the bill, set out in legislation independent, credible institutions with a clear remit from government or parliament, with decisions taken at arm's length and full reporting with maximum transparency.the quality and coherence of statistics across the uk will be improved, and we welcome the full participation of all the devolved administrations in the new approach. it has to be done finger by finger, but it is happening.andrew dilnot said that this is the most important bill in this parliament and he is probably right. it is on a par with the independence of the bank of england."
1542,3/13/2007,Labour,labour,Paul Flynn,"i hark back to many years ago when some statisticians   it is a strange word and it is better to say it in welsh; it is much easier to say ""ystadegau"" than ""statistics"" and i would commend everyone to talk about y bwrdd ystadegau if they have trouble in that direction   came to see me as their constituency mp in the late '80s to complain because the then conservative government were transferring government control of statistics from the cabinet office to the treasury. i acknowledge that britain has a reasonably strong economy. we have supported investment in public services through an increase in taxation from the 1997 base, and we supported independence for the bank of england."
1543,3/21/2007,Liberal Democrat,Others,Menzies Campbell,"i hope that the chancellor in turn will be generous enough to point out that those were liberal democrat policies, which he derided in opposition but adopted in government.i talked about the chancellor's sleight of hand   and i refer the house to page 13 of the red book, and item 15. the overall result is to take a little bit more from the companies sector, and a lot more in the case of some areas and some companies.the chancellor's record is often defended around one central proposition. we are told that his act of genius was to make the bank of england independent when he came into office 10 years ago and that everything else has flowed from that excellent decision."
1544,3/21/2007,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"my colleagues and i are very happy to have an independent bank of england, but we do not believe that it has been as independent as the chancellor has advertised. nobody can get away from the fact that at a crucial time just before the last election the chancellor wrote a very important letter to the monetary policy committee of the bank of england saying that he wished to change the basis on which its targets and instructions rested, and he shifted it from the retail prices index to the consumer prices index. unfortunately, there has been a price for that, because after the general election, with interest rates kept down, we discovered that inflationary pressures had built up."
1545,3/21/2007,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"because of its new cpi target, the bank of england's committee has probably had to raise rates by more than would have been the case without the political intervention.we can see the cost of those interventions   i am sure that there have been more than one   in that over the 10 years of an independent central bank people in britain have had to pay more to borrow money, on average, than people in the united states of america, which has grown more quickly, in japan, which in the early part of the period grew hardly at all but has now been growing quite respectably, or in euroland, where performances have been very patchy but where, on average, growth has been slower than in the united kingdom. it is worrying that we have had to pay a premium over american rates when america has performed so much better. that should tell us not necessarily that an independent central bank is wrong but that our bank was perhaps not independent enough."
1546,3/21/2007,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"it suggests that, because the chancellor's fiscal policy was pulling in the opposite direction to the direction in which monetary policy had to go, the mpc had to put up interest rates more than it would have done. perhaps my hon. friends on the front bench would like to respond further to that later, but that is my understanding.secondly, the government set a low and credible inflation target   credible because it was managed by an independent central bank, which has been long debated."
1547,3/21/2007,Labour,labour,Kitty Ussher,"the effect, which we have seen recently, is to bring down inflationary expectations, and therefore interest rate expectations. however, one problem with a somewhat flat level of stability   i am not suggesting that we have that now   is that it is often a big disincentive to innovation. so we should not look upon stability itself as a tremendous goal, but it must be recognised that we have had great stability in the past decade, and most people in business would give the government credit for that.it has been remarked that one of the most important early developments was giving independence to the bank of england."
1548,3/21/2007,Conservative,conservative,Mark Field,"however, it is less well remembered that in transferring responsibility for interest rates to the bank, the government took away its regulatory role. perhaps he was setting the tone as far as numbers were concerned.the first weakness that the chancellor identified was instability. he referred to the independence of the bank of england, which, even at the time, i supported."
1549,3/22/2007,Conservative,conservative,David Gauke,"it has undoubtedly been a success. the first reason is the golden economic inheritance, including significant supply side reforms, that the chancellor had from the previous, conservative government. the second reason is the decision to give the bank of england independence."
1550,3/26/2007,Conservative,conservative,Peter Luff,"the third reason is the decision not to join the euro. i salute the chancellor for making the latter two decisions, which were positive, if one can call a decision not to join something positive. if i were chancellor, and the bank of england were not independent, i might have tried to use my influence to persuade it not to remove elgar from the Â£20 note in the year of the 150th anniversary of his birth, but that is another matter.sadly, all the chancellor's other decisions have worked to undermine our competitiveness."
1551,3/26/2007,Conservative,conservative,Peter Luff,"in the uniquely benign world environment of the past 10 years, it would have been a scandal if the british economy had not flourished. it is on the rock of the economy that occupational pensions and any other services in our country depend. i tell the house that i do not apologise for the three long-term decisions that i took in 1997 in the interest of stability and growth in this country: first, to make the bank of england independent, which was opposed by the conservatives; secondly, to build a fiscal framework for this country that allowed us to double public investment, which was opposed by the conservatives; and, thirdly, to remove the bias against long-term investment in our economy."
1552,4/17/2007,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"that bias was recognised by the previous chancellor, and, to achieve that, we cut corporation tax by 2p in the pound.if the shadow chancellor wants to cut corporation tax by 2p in the pound, as we did in 1997, why cannot he tell us how he could fund that other than by withdrawing the dividend tax credit? the reduction that he actually achieved.that was the first matter that we had to tackle in one way or another, and through a combination of factors. the other matter   and it relates to why we made the bank of england independent, and why the first act of the incoming labour chancellor was to show that he had the resolve to face the issue of whether it was necessary to raise interest rates   arose because the conservative chancellor, no doubt from sound party political electoral considerations, had refused bank and treasury advice to raise interest rates time after time, and month in, month out."
1553,4/17/2007,Labour,labour,Geoffrey Robinson,"those were the twin matters that we had to address. the reasons we made that decision were quite clear, and it was based on the burden of advice from the inland revenue and from the treasury that we should proceed with the changes that we were making. it was necessary, as were the other decisions that we made about the independence of the bank of england, about raising interest rates and about closing the gap in the disastrous public expenditure levels that we inherited from the tories."
1554,4/17/2007,Labour,labour,Geoffrey Robinson,"i do not want to rehearse again the specious and fallacious arguments made by the opposition, which were comprehensively demolished by the chancellor in his major contribution. it is unbelievable that we are having this debate today, 10 years on, and we can only look forward to the rest of the series of retro-debates. perhaps next week we could have one on the calamitous independence of the bank of england and the consequent interest rate crisis, on the disastrous introduction of a national minimum wage and the consequent inflation shock, or on the disgraceful cuts in corporation taxes which accompanied the removal of the pension fund dividend subsidy, thereby causing a sharp, immediately discernible and outrageous rise in investment."
1555,4/17/2007,Labour,labour,SiÃ´n Simon,"or, with a slightly different flavour, we could debate the consistent reduction of the dividend subsidy by successive tory chancellors   a gradual phasing out of this market distortion, catastrophically prefiguring its eventual, extremely successful, removal by the labour government in 1997.when the removal of a subsidy becomes a smash-and-grab raid, we really are in the world of doublespeak and upside-down-think. gentleman agree that one key to ensuring that we have more stable inflation and interest rates was the decision to give independence to the bank of england to allow the monetary policy committee, rather than a politician, to decide such things? that was obviously a liberal democrat proposal."
1556,5/2/2007,Labour,labour,Tony Blair,"gentleman asks me to tell him something about my right hon. friend, i will tell him about what we have achieved together over these past 10 years: economic stability through the independence of the bank of england; record investment in public services; better maternity leave and maternity pay; more support for pensioners; the repeal of section 28; a ban on tobacco advertising; the climate change levy; and, of course, the minimum wage. what do they all have in common?"
1557,5/10/2007,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"the number of pensioners in poverty has not gone up; it has gone down by 2.1 million. the government made decisions in 1997 to make the bank of england independent, to introduce fiscal rules, to have a windfall tax on the privatised utilities and to make tax changes   all of which have delivered stability in our economy and all of which were opposed by opposition members. government is about making tough decisions; we did that and they opposed them."
1558,5/10/2007,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"speaker, this member of parliament and his party voted against the independence of the bank of england     [ interruption. ] conservative members say that that is history, but we will continue to remind them of the important lessons of history. making the bank of england independent gave us stability and prevented us from returning to the stop-go economics that bedevilled us for 18 years under the conservatives.if the hon."
1559,5/10/2007,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"gentleman was being honest with us about the tax credit situation and his statements reflected what was happening on the ground, he would acknowledge that one of the reasons why we have 2.5 million more people in work is tax credits. friend the chancellor becomes first lord of the treasury, will the minister   who, i am sure, will remain a member of his right hon. friend's team   urge on him that when helping to determine the government's future fiscal policies, he should agree with president-elect sarkozy's strong belief in the importance of retaining large national gold reserves, and with his fierce criticisms of the incompetent behaviour of the independent european central bank?"
1560,6/14/2007,Labour,labour,John Healey,"rpix inflation averaged 3.7 per cent. gentleman will recognise that since the bank of england gained its independence in 1997, the uk has had the best inflation performance for almost a century. the hardest burdens for many families to bear are interest rates that run out of control, which they experienced under the previous government, and inflation running out of control, which they also experienced under the previous government."
1561,6/14/2007,Labour,labour,John Healey,"last month. consistent with the treasury's forecast in the budget, and with the bank of england's may inflation report, independent forecasters expect inflation to return to its target level by the end of the year. i start by congratulating the exchequer secretary on her appointment and by welcoming her to the front bench again."
1562,7/3/2007,Conservative,conservative,Andrew Lansley,"only the week before last, the right hon. lady said that the advisory committee on resource allocation should be given bank of england-style independence. she acknowledged that we were right and that it had been the subject of political interference."
1563,7/18/2007,Labour,labour,Paul Flynn,"i received a letter from margaret thatcher, who was prime minister at the time, stating that it was terribly unworthy to make such a suggestion and reassuring me that the director, jack hibbert, had assured her that if there were any ministerial interference in the figures, he would resign.i am afraid that we have now clearly reached a position   based partly on fact, but mostly on fable   of great cynicism about the objectivity of government statistics. there is a conception of spin, and the government to their great credit have introduced the bill, which has been hailed as one of the most important of the whole parliament and on a par with the decision to grant independence to the bank of england in deciding interest rates. that is absolutely right.i regret that we are in a position of disagreement over the question of pre-release."
1564,7/25/2007,Labour,labour,John McFall,"sir michael answered that question very clearly, saying that his son was a civil servant, and that he phoned him up after the appointment to congratulate him. he was very clear on that, and i have read since that sir michael prepared a report on independence for the bank of england when he was personal assistant to the chancellor of the exchequer at the time, lord lawson, but it was not implemented by that government. his son, tom scholar, however, was involved in the preparation of the report on independence for the bank of england in 1997."
1565,7/25/2007,Labour,labour,John McFall,"the governor of the bank of england has referred to that as ""a scholarly achievement"" and i would endorse that comment.sir michael answered that question very satisfactorily. it is a major reform. as andrew dilnot said, the statistics and registration service bill might be the most important bill in this parliament   at least equivalent to the legislation that gave independence to the bank of england.we welcome the appointment of sir michael."
1566,7/25/2007,Labour,labour,Paul Flynn,"he seems eminently qualified. mention has been made of the treasury permanent secretary being on the appointments panel. i received a letter from the chancellor that suggested that, as well as the permanent secretary, mervyn king, governor of the bank of england, deirdre hutton, chair of the food standards agency, and olivia grant, independent assessor of the office of the commissioner for public appointments, were on the panel."
1567,7/25/2007,Labour,labour,John McFall,"although such appointments do not fall within the remit of the public appointments commission, the committee was pleased with the appointments process.may i also say through the minister to my hon. we are the government who adopted the minimum wage   against conservative advice. we are the government who made the bank of england independent   against conservative advice."
1568,10/10/2007,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"we are the government who have delivered record rises in health expenditure   against conservative advice. we will continue to govern in the interests of the whole country. when we made the bank of england independent, the conservatives opposed it; now they support it."
1569,10/10/2007,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"when we created a minimum wage, they opposed it; now they support it. let me remind the house of those responsibilities. as the house knows, the bank of england has complete independence in monetary policy."
1570,10/11/2007,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"its second core purpose is financial stability, a role that it discharges on a daily basis. the chancellor will know that, under the memorandum of understanding, the principles are unambiguous accountability   the public must know who is responsible for what   transparency and avoidance of duplication. given that the arrangements provide only for partial independence for the bank of england, can he explain, in the context of the market abuse directive   the mad directive as it is called, aptly   and other directives how he is able to discharge his responsibility for the overall functions when he has to look over his shoulder the whole time at what is being decided, potentially, by the european court of justice in relation to european directives that have a direct impact on this matter?"
1571,10/11/2007,Conservative,conservative,William Cash,"how will he resolve that question? in the last three months, we have had a credit bust, which was very visible with a run on a leading mortgage bank, and people now have great difficulty in getting access to the mortgages they might need.if the government are serious about wanting people to be able to buy homes, they must first of all look at their lurch from boom to bust in the credit market, and they have to get the credit and mortgage markets going again. through the chancellor, they need to have conversations with the bank of england about why there was such a catastrophe in britain   worse than anywhere else in the world   over the summer, and about how they can secure sufficient liquidity for the banking system again, with an interest rate structure that makes sense.during that period, the famous, so-called independent bank of england has turned out not to be independent at all, as some of us always suspected."
1572,11/6/2007,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"it turns out to be part of a tripartite arrangement with the treasury and the financial services authority. we now know that most of the crucial decisions taken during the summer were either actively taken by the chancellor and the treasury, or were heavily influenced or cleared through the chancellor and the treasury, illustrating that the bank was not truly independent.what do the government need to do from here? there should be a bill in the queen's speech to introduce proper independence for the bank of england so that we can pursue a more sensible monetary policy."
1573,11/6/2007,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"i am not sure that the chancellor's interventions during the past few weeks have been at all helpful. although we welcome the broader review of the future of the tripartite arrangements, let him tell us when he and the prime minister will take a decision on the reappointment of the governor of the bank of england. dangling the sword of damocles over mervyn king while allowing officials in the treasury and downing street to brief against him may satisfy the vanity of the chancellor and the prime minister, but it does nothing to restore confidence in the independence of the bank of england."
1574,11/14/2007,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"they should have the strength to make the decision about his future and the foresight to ensure that future governors are not treated in this way by adopting longer fixed terms in the way that we propose.stability is the first priority for any chancellor, but tax is the next area that he must command. he may well say that child tax credits and other benefits will help to lift those people out of poverty, but the problem is that the take-up of many of those benefits is very low, and the system of overpayments is leaving many of my constituents with significant difficulties. there is no vision   at best, a sleight of hand, which we will debate in next year's finance bill, as announced in the queen's speech.the chancellor is right that we have had 10 years of relative stability, thanks in no small part to the decision to make the bank of england independent, which we supported at the time."
1575,11/14/2007,Liberal Democrat,Others,Julia Goldsworthy,"however, in the months following the prime minister's last budget as chancellor, it has become increasingly evident that our economy is increasingly exposed to uncertainty. the sad thing for the prime minister is that he had vision once. the proposal to make the bank of england independent, which was put forward when he was first chancellor, and which we supported, demonstrated that."
1576,11/14/2007,Liberal Democrat,Others,Julia Goldsworthy,"however, now the prime minister is old mother hubbard   he goes to the cupboard only to find it bare. therefore, when the bank of england governor and his people sat in a room with the chancellor and his people, the bank of england governor knew everything that there was to know about the banks. the bank knew exactly when big deposits were maturing and when banks were likely to face liquidity difficulties.one of the mistakes that the prime minister made in giving the bank of england independence was in taking away bank regulation and giving it to the fsa."
1577,11/14/2007,Conservative,conservative,John Maples,"he did it because he thought that the bank of england would be far too powerful if it had interest rate-setting power as well as responsibility for regulating the bank system. no, i shall carry on. other such issues include maternity leave, paternity leave and adoption leave, the national minimum wage and, on another treasury matter, the independence of the bank of england."
1578,11/28/2007,Labour,labour,Rob Marris,"they say, ""oh yes, with hindsight, we should have had that policy, but labour got there first."" during one of those episodes, mr. blair claimed that it was his decision to give independence to the governor of the bank of england to set interest rates   a fact that surprised some of us."
1579,12/12/2007,Conservative,conservative,David Amess,"will the prime minister tell the house, in the light of the present government difficulties with the economy, who is responsible for the terrible shambles that the government are in? i am happy to tell the hon. gentleman that it was the government who made the decision to make the bank of england independent."
1580,12/12/2007,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"i am afraid i have to remind him that that was opposed every inch of the way in the lobby by the conservative party. many of us were worried by the speed of the company's expansion, but we did not know   although the directors must have known   that it was five times more exposed than any other uk bank to borrowing from the markets, relative to the size of the institution.there were clearly failings in the regulatory system, including due to the division between responsibility for regulation and the position of lender of last resort. the prime minister created that division when he was chancellor, alongside his commendable action of giving the bank of england independence over monetary policy, for which i had long argued, but it has proved, in this instance, to be an unsatisfactory division of responsibility.it can just about be argued, although i am not entirely convinced by the argument, that the run on the bank might have been forestalled by earlier injections of liquidity into the system by the bank of england."
1581,12/12/2007,Liberal Democrat,Others,Alan Beith,"however, we must bear it in mind that liquidity was exceptionally low at that time. members should also be angry with the government for setting up the tripartite arrangement.the hon. member for louth and horncastle (sir peter tapsell) raised the issue of what happened when the bank of england was made independent."
1582,12/12/2007,Liberal Democrat,Others,Julia Goldsworthy,"however, the issue that he raised was not to do with that, but with who took on oversight of the banks. the way it did so was to spend as little as possible on maintaining the network. i welcomed the creation of network rail, which was a lib-dem proposal   one of the ones that the government nicked, dare i say, along with many others, including independence for the bank of england and so on."
1583,1/8/2008,Liberal Democrat,Others,Norman Baker,"nevertheless, network rail is a much better solution and we are happy that it was created.let us move towards a seven-day railway. that was the first statement made to me at the treasury. that is why we made the bank of england independent, a more opposed by the conservative party, and that is why, as a result of our actions, interest rates are half what they were under the conservative government on average, inflation is half what it was, and employment is at a record level."
1584,1/9/2008,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"we are proud of our record as a labour government. as someone who inherited a very difficult economic situation from him in 1997, may i tell him that we have observed all our fiscal rules. we made the bank of england independent against his advice."
1585,1/23/2008,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"we have had 10 years of growth, which the conservatives would never have had. what sort of undertakings did he give to sir richard branson and others to pay their fees for private bids? when will he commission a fully independent audit through the bank of england to establish the quality of the assets   the loan book for which this enormous sum of public money has been advanced?"
1586,2/18/2008,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"when will there be democratic scrutiny of the new business model, which could involve contraction or expansion of the bank? however, we have had plenty of evidence to the contrary, including not just the evidence given yesterday, but serious brokers' reviews. for example, panmure gordon has said that bad debts were systematically hidden.there were therefore all sorts of problems with the bank and the next step   which i advocated yesterday and on the day of the announcement, and which has been taken up today   is for a proper, independent audit under the supervision of the bank of england, and not carried out by the fsa, to investigate how sound the bank and its mortgage book are.the second inheritance from the past is the costs of delay."
1587,2/19/2008,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"what were they? if we are, in effect, standing behind the liabilities of the british banking system, then we as the taxpayer need to know that the financial services authority is regulating banks much more closely, and particularly watching those that are paying high rates of interest and making risky loans.i end by referring to a point that i made in a previous speech on this subject. when the bank of england was given independence to set interest rates, the government made a mistake with regard to the regulatory system."
1588,2/19/2008,Conservative,conservative,John Maples,"i understand why they did it, but taking bank regulation away from the bank and giving it to the financial services authority was a mistake. given the way in which the chancellor is taking such peremptory powers for himself, he owes it to us during the course of this debate to answer certain key questions. is there any longer any credence in the independence of the bank of england?"
1589,2/19/2008,Conservative,conservative,Philip Dunne,"what should the bank of england be responsible for, operationally, if not for the provisions in the bill? to ask the bank of england to conduct a separate audit would not be appropriate. that is not the bank's area of expertise; it is not a professional independent auditor but a central bank."
1590,2/21/2008,Labour,labour,Yvette Cooper,"interestingly, the amendment would not require an independent audit of northern rock within three months because it applies to clause 6, whereas the draft order that we have published would be made under clause 3. friend's question is that inflation here is less than in the euro area and half that in the united states. the reason for that is that when we gave the bank of england independence to deal with monetary policy and interest rates, we gave it a very clear remit."
1591,3/6/2008,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"that has resulted in our inflation being historically low. it is the bank that should have overall supervision of liquidity; it is the bank that keeps day-to-day watch on the money markets; it is the bank that should have working knowledge of the bigger banks' operations. that is why i would like to see the bank of england with its authority restored as a properly independent central bank, not simply the interest rate-setting arm of the treasury."
1592,3/10/2008,Conservative,conservative,Michael Fallon,"in the end, it is the governor   not the chancellor and not the chairman of the fsa   who should be the ultimate guardian of our financial system. at the end of all this, i would prefer a definition of exactly which financial institutions are systemically important. i would like that defined, perhaps by the bank of england in its financial stability report, but certainly by an authority independent of government, not by shifting political calculations and emergency meetings of ministers, so that it is clear to everybody which financial institutions cannot be allowed to fail and which ones still can.the second related question is, what are banks today?"
1593,3/10/2008,Conservative,conservative,Michael Fallon,"was northern rock, for example, really a bank? in the past, our economy suffered from high unemployment and high inflation, but today unemployment is lower than in germany, france and italy.welfare reform makes work pay and encourages people off benefits. our strengthened competition regime has increased the flexibility of product and labour markets, backed by fair employment laws.so the reforms that we have made since 1997   independence for the bank of england and tough fiscal rules   mean that britain is now more resilient and more prepared to deal with future shocks, and it is better equipped to meet the challenges of rapid global change.we are developing new strengths in the industries of the future   the creative industries account for 7 per cent."
1594,3/12/2008,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,of our economy; pharmaceuticals account for a quarter of the uk's research and development.ours is the only major industrial economy to see an increasing share of trade in global services   from 7 per cent. he said that the way in which the banks have sought to package and sell unsecured debt is not a factor in the problems that we now face. i disagree   i think that their use of extreme financial technology has been a major factor in those problems.one of the key tools that will see us through is the independence of the bank of england.
1595,3/12/2008,Liberal Democrat,Others,John Thurso,"i welcome the fact that, for the first time in its history, the bank is independent at a time when the economy is being tested. we face serious global challenges and serious pressures in the financial markets. they will inevitably have an impact on the uk, just as they will on countries across the world, but we start off in a stronger condition than many of our european competitors and many countries across the world, in part because of decisions that were made on issues such as bank of england independence, which the right hon."
1596,3/18/2008,Labour,labour,Yvette Cooper,"and learned member for rushcliffe always opposed, and on investing in britain's future. he is desperate to head it off and is doing whatever he can.our problem is that the government are enormously constrained in what they can do that is similar. they made a good decision 10 years ago to make the bank of england independent."
1597,4/2/2008,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"the bank now sets interest rates, which are not politically driven, and is making it absolutely clear that its first responsibility is to follow its mandate, which takes account of inflation, which is currently above the level that it should be pursuing. he was looking to others to bail him out of a situation he has created for himself. he was encouraging the bank of england to cut rates to boost growth   the bank of england that he made independent."
1598,4/2/2008,Conservative,conservative,Mark Hoban,"he has set an inflation target for the bank, but he was looking for it to put that target to one side. this is not something that we can legislate for; at the end of the day, it has to be for companies themselves.i dealt earlier with the point about passing on the benefits of interest rate reductions to home owners. this action, which comes on top of other action that the bank has taken independently or with other central banks, of putting money into the system, has helped."
1599,4/21/2008,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"i do not think that last summer anyone would have envisaged that what we now see in the financial markets would have gone on for so long and be so deep in so many countries. throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the mainstream political debates of the day hinged on questions of economic decentralisation. the big debates were about whether and how to decentralise control of the economy, trade union reform, making the bank of england independent, privatisation and the big bang in the city."
1600,4/30/2008,Conservative,conservative,Douglas Carswell,"each of those issues was a step towards decentralising economic control. gentleman knows, the bank of england and its monetary policy committee are entirely independent of government, and neither i, nor my predecessor, have commented on what they do, because it is important that they conduct those things independently. the bank of england is, of course, making its decision today, but it is doing so against a background of a strong and stable economy over the past 10 years."
1601,6/5/2008,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"member for cities of london and westminster (mr. field), the bank of england's monetary policy committee is independent of government. that is one of the main reasons why our inflation levels are now at a historically very low level, and i am not going to change government policy so far as that is concerned.the oecd, along with other independent commentators, has made the point that, across the world, economies are slowing down and, as i said in the budget, ours is no exception."
1602,6/24/2008,Conservative,conservative,Philip Hammond,"indeed, for many of us, it shaped our perceptions for half a lifetime. then, after the conservative government introduced inflation targeting in 1992 and the incoming labour government reinforced that move in 1997 by creating the independent monetary policy committee of the bank of england, it ceased, for a decade or more, to be an issue on the political radar screen.how tempting it was, therefore, to believe the rhetoric of the then chancellor, our prime minister, that the dragon of inflation had really been slain   that the sunlit uplands of endless economic growth, low interest rates and appreciating asset values had been reached without the unwelcome spectre of inflation spoiling the view. indeed, the prime minister built his entire reputation on the claim to have been the man who delivered economic stability   who ended boom and bust."
1603,6/24/2008,Labour (Co-op),labour,Andrew Love,"will the hon. gentleman accept that the former chancellor built his reputation on the independence of the bank of england, which the hon. gentleman's party did not support at the time, and that that has been a major weapon against inflation?"
1604,6/24/2008,Conservative,conservative,Philip Hammond,"gentleman had been listening, he would have heard me say a few moments ago that inflation targeting was introduced by a conservative government and reinforced by independence of the bank of england, which we, in turn, are now committed to reinforcing still further in a way that this government have resisted. friend remember that, far from creating an independent bank of england, the chancellor gutted and filleted it, taking away debt management and nationalising it into the treasury, and taking away day-to-day banking supervision, so that the bank was blind and deaf in the money markets when the credit crunch hit? is not that a major problem?"
1605,6/24/2008,Labour,labour,Yvette Cooper,"there have been benefits from world commodity prices, largely thanks to developing countries. there have also been significant benefits as a result of our making the bank of england independent   a decision which, as the hon. gentleman will recall, was opposed by his party   and there have been changes to support more competitive and global markets across the board."
1606,6/24/2008,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"they have not told us how they are wasting that Â£500 million, but we know that they have wasted billions on computerisation, unneeded regional government in england, id cards, too many officials and administrators and too many external consultants coming in to do the jobs that officials do not seem to be able to do so that we are paying twice for everything that goes on in the government. that amounts to massive waste, which the government's own gershon review admitted, as confirmed by conservative party work.at the core of the debate there should, i think, be a serious examination of one of the most misleading soundbites of the past 11 years   the soundbite that the government created an independent bank of england, which dealt with the inflation problem and gave us economic stability. the house should remember that the government almost lost their governor of the bank of england when they shoved through their bodged reforms of the bank in 1997-98."
1607,6/24/2008,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"far from making the bank independent, they stripped it of its responsibility to manage public debt and its responsibility to have day-to-day supervision of the clearing banks.when the credit crunch and the crisis hit, the bank of england was blind and deaf to its own money markets and did not know minute by minute what the government's debt position was   crucial to the functioning of the money markets   and it did not know minute by minute what the clearing banks' position was, when they were clearly extremely short of funds. that meant that at the crucial point where the bank needed to be expert at running the money markets to enforce the rates laid down by the monetary policy committee, it was not able to do so. the monetary policy committee is alleged to be independent."
1608,6/24/2008,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"the government's best case is that the mpc was made a bit more independent; clearly, the bank of england was very badly damaged by being made less independent, as it lost big functions. even the mpc was not really made independent, however. of course, the issue is about the availability of credit, but it is also about official interest rates and the implications for mortgage borrowers and small businesses."
1609,10/6/2008,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"i have been a very strong advocate of the independence of the bank of england; i made my maiden speech about it in this house 10 years ago. does the chancellor not think it appropriate, in emergency conditions, to make it absolutely clear that the mandate of the bank of england must include responsibility for averting a meltdown in the financial and economic system? gentleman is dangerous   whatever else he is, that is not quite the right description   but i think that in this case he is just wrong."
1610,10/6/2008,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"if one establishes an independent central bank, distant from government, i do not think that one should change its terms of reference just because times are difficult. i should just remind him and the house of what the bank of england act 1998 says. gentleman may have campaigned for an independent central bank, but i was part of the treasury team that legislated to put the measures in place."
1611,10/6/2008,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"to be fair, the liberal democrats have been consistent on the issue, and did support an independent central bank. however, if they are to be consistent, they should not, for goodness' sake, ask for a change of rules when things get difficult. does the chancellor agree that without in any way compromising the independence of the bank of england, he could put into abeyance the inflation target for a period, and therefore allow the bank to take the steps necessary to prevent the present crisis from spilling over into the rest of the economy?"
1612,10/6/2008,Liberal Democrat,Others,Susan Kramer,"our experience so far has shown that the idea that financial crises could be contained is holed below the waterline, and that the inevitable consequences of not stemming overspill will be detrimental to just about everybody in the country. it was designed for the good times as well as the more difficult times. to chop and change it would undermine the idea and principles that underpin the concept of an independent central bank."
1613,10/7/2008,Conservative,conservative,Philip Hammond,"i will make a little progress first.the greatest structural weakness in our economy, however, is the absence of effective fiscal discipline, which, along with the explosion of consumer debt and the asset price bubble, has been the root cause of the age of irresponsibility, of which the prime minister has spoken so eloquently. at the end of an unprecedented period of world economic growth, however, the uk has net debt at a higher proportion of gross domestic product than in 1997   without taking account of the billions salted away through enron-style accounting practices, off the balance sheet, out of sight and out of mind.it was not that the incoming labour government did not recognise the issue in 1997, or that they denied the importance of fiscal discipline. far from it   the then chancellor placed his fiscal rules at the heart of his economic strategy, alongside bank of england independence, as one of the key building blocks in his claimed commitment to fiscal and economic stability."
1614,10/7/2008,Conservative,conservative,Philip Hammond,"however, like the debt-fuelled boom, the fiscal rules have turned out to be an illusion. friend the member for tatton set out last week would give the uk the most credible and responsible fiscal policy framework in the world. alongside the independent bank of england   with the enhanced responsibilities that we have proposed, now included in the banking reform bill, and the additional powers that we propose to give it under our debt responsibility mechanism to respond to the threat of excessive debt being created in the system as a whole   the uk will have the strongest, most independent and most credible fiscal and economic stability framework of any nation in the world."
1615,10/7/2008,Conservative,conservative,Philip Hammond,"the point about public sector pension schemes is that they represent another large, unrecognised liability that currently sits off the balance sheet. critically, that institution should have powers to make policy recommendations so that this parliament can hold government to account. it can grow in stature to develop the strength and credibility of the independent bank of england and become, in time, one of the twin pillars of independent oversight that will deliver long-term stability and freedom from short-term political manipulation to the management of britain's economy.it is, of course, too late to fix the roof for the storm that is already blowing up around us, but we owe it to the country and to future generations to ensure that we live within our means and that the age of irresponsibility in government is now buried for ever."
1616,10/7/2008,Labour,labour,Mark Todd,"my age means that i reflect back on some of these subjects with perhaps more distance than the hon. i am not sure whether he is in fact younger than me; perhaps he is, but his memory certainly seems shorter.it is worth reflecting on the original purpose of the fiscal rules when they were drawn up in 1997. they, together with the step of providing independence to the bank of england, were intended primarily to provide reassurance to the market of the discipline of an incoming labour government."
1617,10/7/2008,Labour,labour,Mark Todd,"that was then reinforced by a variety of actions. arguably, as i have said, we have suffered relative poverty in that area, with some degree of complacency. we now need to resource that independent ons better.i noted, and was worried by, the concerns expressed by the bank of england about the quality of the data used for its decisions about setting interest rates."
1618,10/7/2008,Labour,labour,Mark Todd,"i think that my honourable colleague on the treasury committee, the hon. gentleman to have been apparently so arrogant and wise on these matters.there is much more to be done in building consensus. by and large we have protected the independence of the bank of england and the operation of the monetary policy committee as an area of relative political consensus."
1619,10/7/2008,Labour,labour,Mark Todd,"there are some worrying signs   here i criticise the hon. friend even more.the proposal on rules is worrying because, as i said, the only rule is that there are no rules. that point has something in common with bank of england independence."
1620,10/7/2008,Labour,labour,Austin Mitchell,"we imposed a rule that it was to manage inflation only, which tied us to something like a one-club approach to golfing, and we are now in a different situation where we need the flexibility that the fed has in the usa. we should have that, too. i am glad that the liberal democrats have caught up with the proposal that i put to the treasury committee during last year's review of 10 years of the performance of bank of england independence, which was that the rubric should be widened."
1621,10/7/2008,Labour,labour,Austin Mitchell,"they always get there in the end, and i hope that they read more of my ideas on my website. those are changes that put the uk in a very strong position, compared with others.there are five reasons for this. first, bank of england independence has given us interest rates and inflation well below the double-digit levels that we saw in earlier decades."
1622,10/7/2008,Labour,labour,Stephen Timms,"secondly, our labour market is the most flexible in europe, with employment remaining high and more than half a million job vacancies. i am very glad that he has welcomed the action taken by the bank of england to cut interest rates to 4Â½ per cent. i hope that he will recall that, when he pressed me two days ago to intervene and take away the bank of england's independence, i said that i thought that the remit was adequate to allow it to do what was right   and so it seems to have turned out."
1623,10/8/2008,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"again, i am grateful to my hon. friend for his support, and i agree with him about the decision taken by the bank of england, which of course is independent of the government; i attach considerable importance to that. the fact that it and the other central banks of all the major economies took the same decision at the same time sends a very important message."
1624,10/9/2008,Labour,labour,George Mudie,"lending policies are being considered and salary policies are on the table. we ought to have our representative in there to ensure that our part of the deal is delivered.i am sad that the liberals have departed from bank of england independence. that independence was given and supported, but when things get tough they want to take it away."
1625,10/9/2008,Labour,labour,George Mudie,"the bank of england and the government must improve their relationships a bit, including more trust and more partnership, but taking independence away from the bank would be a wrong step. obviously, the whole house welcomes the financial rescue package, but it is not the end, or even the beginning of the end, of stabilising our financial and business worries. if the audit process just allows the big five audit companies to make a lot of money by going through a process, but gives no real information to the public or politicians as to the underlying health of the company, there is something wrong."
1626,10/9/2008,Labour,labour,Diane Abbott,"such audits are not aiding transparency, regulation or public understanding.this view will be extremely unpopular, but i am the only person in the chamber, and one of the few members still in parliament, who voted against independence for the bank of england in 1997. i voted against it because of just this eventuality. the history of the bank in past financial crises, going all the way back to the 1930s, is that when it is asked to choose between bearing down on inflation, and the growth and health of the real economy, it has always chosen to bear down on inflation."
1627,10/9/2008,Labour,labour,Diane Abbott,"that is the danger of an independent bank of england, about which i spoke 10 years ago. an independent bank of england that chases inflation above all is marvellous when the going is good. when the going is bad, however, we will see why some of us would not vote for such independence."
1628,10/9/2008,Conservative,conservative,Ann Winterton,"lady makes an interesting point. does she not agree that when the bank of england was made independent, certain of its previous powers were transferred to the fsa? does she believe that the fsa has acted in the meantime, as it ought to have done, to ensure that the banks had sufficient reserves?"
1629,10/13/2008,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"gentleman said a month or so ago. i am sure that the decision taken by the monetary policy committee of the bank of england was welcomed here, as was the co-ordinated decision right across the world, but that decision was of course taken by the independent bank of england, and rightly so. no, i shall make some progress; otherwise it will not be fair to those who wish to speak in the debate.the bill will build on that framework, and i shall outline the broad scheme that it follows."
1630,10/14/2008,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"whether it was intentional or not   we have our own views on that   we have been through the reappointment of eddie george and mervyn king, and in both cases the decision became somewhat charged. our proposal is that, rather like the european central bank and other central banks, we should move the governor to a single, non-renewable term so that there is no question of independence being challenged by a reappointment. i absolutely would not allow the bank of england's remit to be changed in a crisis."
1631,10/14/2008,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"there is no point having an independent central bank if at the moment we get any kind of trouble we suspend the remit or change the target. no independent central bank in the world would last if that were the case. the target set by the government includes not just an inflation target but a responsibility on financial stability, and as last week's decision by the governor demonstrated, he is perfectly capable of taking into consideration broader issues of financial stability as well as his inflation target remit."
1632,10/14/2008,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"it would not be independent. the shadow chancellor keeps using the term ""independence of the bank of england"", but surely it is within the gift of the chancellor to set the inflation target, therefore putting in abeyance or adjusting the inflation target, which still leaves the bank independent to make a decision on the facts as it sees them. again, i come back to the point that if the chancellor of the exchequer changes the target in the middle of a crisis, and basically mandates the bank to pursue another course, we cannot properly call it an independent central bank."
1633,10/14/2008,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"that means that the regulator would have the power to take pre-emptive action to control the overall lending of banks in the system when there was a danger of an asset boom.we have to address the problem   in the end, the solution offered by alan greenspan, the honorary economic adviser to the prime minister, did not sufficiently address it   of how we deal with asset price booms. we have got independent central banks to deal with retail price inflation, but how do we deal with asset price booms? after the events of the past month, the greenspan approach, from the man who opened the new treasury building, which is just to let the bubble burst and pick up the pieces afterwards, is clearly not one that we should allow to be taken again."
1634,10/14/2008,Conservative,conservative,Mark Hoban,"i am sure that if he gets his wish and serves on the public bill committee, he and others will wish to debate that fully.the bill could have been the means to put long-term reforms in place. for example, the conservatives believe that it is vital to strengthen the independence of the bank of england, and we want the governor and the members of the monetary policy committee to be appointed for a longer single term, rather than for up to two terms. such an approach would put beyond doubt any prospect that reappointment could influence the decisions of mpc members or the governor and his deputies."
1635,10/14/2008,Conservative,conservative,Mark Hoban,"we think that it is important to strengthen, rather than weaken, the independence of the bank of england. unlike the liberal democrats, we are not going to ditch the independence of the bank when the going gets tough.the conservatives believe that the bank of england's role in regulation could be strengthened too. that issue has been discussed by my hon."
1636,10/15/2008,Conservative,conservative,Andrew Tyrie,"it is not just banks that missed what was on their balance sheets; the government, and the structure of systemic risk management that they introduced, have also failed. the institutional arrangements that were established as a consequence of bank of england independence were clearly seriously deficient. the tripartite committee was created as a residual body, as an afterthought after the decision to strip the bank of england of its regulatory function had been taken.how should we deal with the systemic risk issue?"
1637,10/20/2008,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"gentleman's recollection of history, but i should tell him that aig is an insurance company   it is not registered as a bank in the same way   and that in the old days it would have been regulated as an insurance company, not as a bank. i should also tell him that he opposed, or his party opposed, the independence of the bank of england, which i believe his party came to regret after a few years. the bank of england has always had responsibility     [interruption.] it is very interesting that conservative members try to change the subject whenever i mention the independence of the bank of england."
1638,10/20/2008,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"it has always been the case that the bank of england has had responsibilities for financial stability. i may not quite be cicero   my humility extends that far, although i am told that demosthenes was a little chap   yet in analysing the history of booms and busts, i have tried to be honest in what i write.i can refer the house to a document that i wrote in 1993, which, i am reliably assured by someone who subsequently worked in no. 10, was pinched almost wholesale by the then chancellor and turned into public policy   at least the good bits were, such as its recommendation for independence for the bank of england, but not, i am afraid, the other good bits calling for caution and good sense in the management of the economic cycle."
1639,10/21/2008,Conservative,conservative,Alan Duncan,"it is all there, and perhaps the now prime minister should read it once again and realise his own folly.the prime minister inherited the best economy that any democratic party has bequeathed to another. how wrong he was. i know that opposition members opposed and voted against the independence of the bank of england at the beginning, but after time they said that they supported it."
1640,10/30/2008,Labour,labour,Yvette Cooper,"clearly, they have now changed their position again. i have to say to the hon. gentleman that i think it is right to have an independent bank of england."
1641,10/30/2008,Labour,labour,Yvette Cooper,"that is why interest rates are 4.5 per cent. he does not understand that since we rejected his policies and made the bank of england independent and took the right course, we have had 10 years of economic growth, 10 years of stability, and 10 years in which 3 million jobs have been created. we were not in negative growth in the second quarter."
1642,11/5/2008,Conservative,conservative,Stephen Dorrell,"does the prime minister agree that it would be an absurd dumbing down of the principle of democracy if last week he felt himself able, quite rightly, to express his views about the antics of russell brand and jonathan ross as employees of the independent bbc but felt himself unable this week to express his views about the increasingly obvious fact that the independent bank of england has moved too slowly and by too small a margin to reduce interest rates? may i just quote back to the right hon. gentleman what the shadow chancellor said when the bank of england was made independent?"

1644,11/10/2008,Conservative,conservative,Philip Hammond,"] that is the point: while those of us who belong to parties that are either in government or aspire to be in government studiously try to respect the independence of the bank of england, the hon. gentleman apparently regards himself as free to indulge in wildly populist and contradictory demands on our television screens. it is one thing to observe that there is a considerable gap between the level of uk and us interest rates, which was precisely the point that my hon."
1645,11/10/2008,Conservative,conservative,Philip Hammond,"friend the shadow chancellor was making, but quite another thing to call for a reduction after having just told one's party conference that the government must not compromise the independence of the bank of england by telling it to slash interest rates.i want to be a little more consensual, however, and to return to the point where we agree with the liberal democrat motion   at least to some extent. of course, this is not just a us-made problem, and the sooner the government can take that on board and accept that this is a problem for which the uk regulatory and policy regime is partly responsible    i welcome that very much indeed.i return to the theme that i have raised many times in the house: the government ought to retain control of the levers of economic management, which are several, but i shall mention the three main ones, the first of which is interest rates."
1646,11/10/2008,Labour,labour,Kelvin Hopkins,"i was an opponent of giving the bank of england so-called independence. interest rates should be controlled by the government, who should be accountable to the house for their policy on interest rates. i am sorry to disappoint my hon."
1647,11/11/2008,Labour,labour,Caroline Flint,"friend, but it is not for the government to comment on the monetary policy of the central bank of the eurozone, not only because the uk is not a member of the eurozone but because it is absolutely right that monetary policy should be set independently, which is why we gave the bank of england independence in 1997. however, i am pleased that the european investment bank is providing â‚¬30 billion, which is available to small businesses, to support them in the months ahead. importantly, we made it clear that, within our commitment to fiscal sustainability, the broad and international policy response would need to encompass both monetary and fiscal policy action."
1648,11/17/2008,Labour,labour,Gordon Brown,"although it is for independent central banks to make their own decisions, we recognised the importance of monetary policy to the restoration of growth. some contended that it was impossible to cut interest rates in britain for fiscal reasons, but, in fact, the bank has now, in two successive months, made two cuts worth in total 2 per cent. part of the current problem, however, as the governor of the bank of england, the international monetary fund and the oecd have said, is that these are not normal times and the normal way in which the effects of the central bank's interest rates are translated straight into the wider economy is simply not happening."
1649,11/26/2008,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"that is why i believe that, yes, it is important to have appropriate monetary policy, which has to be decided by the independent bank of england, but that it has to be supported by government action to support the economy as well. in other words, fiscal policy has to support monetary policy. and learned member for rushcliffe (mr."
1650,11/26/2008,Labour,labour,Yvette Cooper,"clarke), having long been an opponent of bank of england independence, brought himself to support the bank's role in the current events. member for tatton seemed to be calling for radical monetary policy; it sounded to me as if what he was actually calling for was an end to the independence of the bank of england and for him to set interest rates instead. yes, of course we will support it, but the problem with the government's approach is that they keep legislating for things that they are not achieving."
1651,12/3/2008,Labour,labour,Austin Mitchell,"he told us that markets were the answer, when it is markets that got us into this position in the first place. he criticised the failure to reduce interest rates, although he knows full well that those rates are controlled by the bank of england, independently of the government   a development that his party welcomed. i was pretty critical of it, but all that contributed to high interest rates, which he denounced as the cause of the problem.the right hon."
1652,12/15/2008,Conservative,conservative,Robert Syms,"however, it is also legitimate to say that there are signs that we have gone into a difficult period rather less prepared than we could have been. a lot of that goes back to one of the first decisions that this government made, which was to give independence to the bank of england. two things then occurred: the financial services authority was set up to regulate banking; and a lot of the big disasters occurred under that system, which has also given us occupational pensions, the equitable life situation and the various other things that have gone wrong in the past few years.i rather think that the previous system, in which the bank of england regulated the city, was better."
1653,12/15/2008,Conservative,conservative,Philip Dunne,"we have heard much talk about the regulatory problems being not of our making. i remind labour members that the new banking regulatory system, which was put in place 10 years ago by the then chancellor, now prime minister, and the then chief secretary, now chancellor, was found wanting a year ago when the northern rock crisis took place and the financial services authority itself admitted that it had not regulated properly.when conservative members argued in favour of the independence of the bank of england, we were not arguing in favour of the fsa taking over banking regulation   that was not how we saw it then or see it today. when northern rock got into difficulty last year, the government were unable to take the swift decisions necessary in order to deal with the crisis as it arose."
1654,12/17/2008,Conservative,conservative,Stephen Crabb,"contrary to assurances given at the last international development questions, united kingdom taxpayers are supporting the zimbabwean government via the global fund. yes, and the forecasts that we set out were broadly the same as the bank of england's, which are entirely independent of ours. this country has a choice: we can either let the recession take its course, which is the policy that the conservative party seems to advocate, or we can decide to take action to help people and businesses."
1655,1/19/2009,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"it will initially purchase high-quality private sector assets, such as corporate bonds, commercial paper and syndicated loans, which companies use to finance their business.the assets purchased by the bank of england will be good-quality investments, which will eventually be sold, so the taxpayers' interests are protected, and will enable larger companies to get the funding they need at a lower cost. the operating remit of the scheme will be set by the government, but it will be run on an independent basis by the bank of england. when purchasing those assets, the bank of england will ensure that the total amount of money in the economy does not increase."
1656,2/12/2009,Labour,labour,Ian Pearson,"i am not distancing myself from it at all. i am just making it clear that the fsa is an independent regulator and takes its own decisions, although it works closely with the other tripartite authorities, the bank of england and ourselves in her majesty's treasury. it is also all the more reason for the government to step in to help to support businesses and families.that approach is supported right across the world, and the conservatives are virtually isolated as far as that is concerned."
1657,2/12/2009,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"it has been backed by the independent institute for fiscal studies   which is often favourably cited by the conservatives when it suits them   and, even yesterday, the bank of england's inflation report made the case that if government support comes through, it will make a substantial difference to the position that would otherwise be the case. we are clear that supporting the banks and supporting our economy are absolutely essential, and i am sorry that the conservative party cannot bring itself to give that support, because it is pretty essential for the future of our country. it will all make a difference."

1659,2/26/2009,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"will he now impose the full independent, asset by asset audit of the british banks that the governor of the bank of england has just called for in the treasury committee and that i called for at the dispatch box last month?finally, on excessive bonuses and rewards for failure, once again the chancellor has promised there will be none. yet this morning he said in his radio interview that he learned only a very short time ago that sir fred goodwin was paid off with a Â£650,000 a year pension funded by the taxpayer. friend the member for putney (justine greening)?"
1660,3/9/2009,Conservative,conservative,Andrew MacKay,"surely he is not really saying   notwithstanding the independence of the bank of england   that the house should not discuss, debate and question quantitative easing when it has led to the biggest printing of money in our lifetime. will he give an assurance that that will happen? lady knows, the monetary policy committee is the responsibility of the bank of england, which operates independently."
1661,3/9/2009,Labour,labour,Stephen Timms,"it chose the figure it wanted to adopt. i am glad that the government no longer talk of ""no more boom and bust"". even they see how absurd that is, but it is disappointing that they still tell us that they made the bank of england independent."

1663,3/18/2009,Conservative,conservative,Robert Syms,"i think we had a problem with burmah oil, which ran out of cash and lost its shares in british petroleum to the government, who bailed it out.the crisis was similar, but the difference was that the bank of england knew what was going on, got money together and sorted out the banking system in a few years. the changes that the prime minister made when he was chancellor to the independence of the bank of england have made a difference to our regulatory regime. had the bank of england retained its former role, i cannot conceive of being where we are today.having said that, the city is a vast institution and we have some sophisticated banks."
1664,3/23/2009,Labour,labour,Jack Straw,"speaker, i should like to make a statement on the green paper ""rights and responsibilities: developing our constitutional framework"", which was laid before parliament today. it is the next stage in what has been described as a quiet revolution in our constitutional arrangements, which, since 1997, has included: independence for the bank of england; devolution for scotland, wales and northern ireland; independence for national statistics; the human rights act 1998; the freedom of information act 2000 and the data protection act 1998; and reforms to the house of lords and of party funding.this green paper deals with some of the most fundamental questions we face as individuals and as a society: how we live together; what rights and freedoms we enjoy, and from whom; and what duties and obligations we owe, and to whom. those issues are not abstractions, removed from the practical politics of jobs and housing, health care, education, crime and disorder, because these constitutional arrangements determine how power is distributed, and therefore the conditions in which every other question in our public life will be answered.it is because of the centrality of these issues that my right hon."
1665,3/25/2009,Labour,labour,Harriet Harman,"i know that he agrees with that, so i do not know why he decries the international action that the prime minister is taking. with reference to the bank of england, it was this government who made the bank of england independent as to its interest rates. i thank the leader of the house for giving us the forthcoming business."
1666,3/30/2009,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"this, however, would not have provided the dunfermline with a long-term solution. first, it was the judgment of the bank of england, the fsa and the treasury that even with an injection of Â£60 million, the society would have been very unlikely to have an independent long-term future, and that it would have needed to come back for more. secondly, the society would not have been able to service or repay this amount of new capital; in the past few years it has never made an annual profit of more than Â£6 million."
1667,3/31/2009,Conservative,conservative,Graham Brady,"it made a bad start   a point that i raised in the select committee   by being seen to act on behalf of ministers in the matter of sir fred goodwin's pension, even though ukfi admits that it did not have a specific remit to do so. if, as i think we all hope, the taxpayer is to emerge eventually bearing as little cost as possible from the ownership of those bank assets, ukfi needs a clear mandate, clear independence and clear objectives to that end, looking at how, ultimately, we will extricate ourselves from the present position.i shall not go over the ground that has already been covered regarding the depths of the financial crisis, the efforts that have been made to combat it through monetary and fiscal policy, and the quantitative easing that is being embarked upon by the bank of england. some of those measures may be entirely necessary and appropriate, but they do not come without a cost in the longer term.the g20 has been mentioned, as it is meeting in london over the next couple of days."
1668,4/27/2009,Conservative,conservative,Kenneth Clarke,"the regulatory system that failed completely in this country was the creation of this government. their first dramatic act when they came into office, along with making the bank of england independent, was to take away the bank's regulatory function and give that to a new all-singing, all-dancing financial services authority, which was a total failure. that was the origin of this."
1669,4/28/2009,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"lady is quite right that we always need to be mindful of the harm that inflation can cause, which is why we set the bank of england an inflation target of 2 per cent., which i confirmed again last week in the budget. the bank of england has been operationally independent of the government for more than 10 years, and that has been widely supported and accepted. however, the bank has a responsibility to meet that target, both in setting out how much it will put into the economy through quantitative easing and in its interest rate policy."
1670,4/28/2009,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"indeed, he and i have tabled a motion on the order paper today, expressing his anxieties and saying that we must rise to the challenge.in conclusion, i want to refer to the process whereby we pursue matters, as opposed to substance and specific items. in the past, we have said that there needs to be an advance in the discussion of government budgets and fiscal policy, comparable with that which made the bank of england independent. for 20 years, governments in this country and elsewhere struggled with inflation and having an inflation anchor."
1671,4/28/2009,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"the concept of independent central banks has been implemented and will be important in the uk as the economy recovers and we get back to inflation. we have nothing comparable for fiscal policy apart from the rules, which have been widely disregarded. but it was not the americans who allowed mortgages of 125 per cent."
1672,5/6/2009,Conservative,conservative,Tobias Ellwood,"in the uk, and it certainly was not the americans who, when the bank of england became independent, handed over responsibility for certain rules to the financial services authority. the fsa then relaxed those rules, allowing banks to lend and get into debt on a scale that we are now beginning to regret.i return to my intervention on the chief secretary about the cut in vat from 17.5 per cent. we have been hit by the same global economic storm as everyone else, but britain has fared so much worse than other countries, thanks to decisions taken by the prime minister over the 10 years that he was chancellor."
1673,5/6/2009,Conservative,conservative,Tobias Ellwood,"most notable was the decision to remove key regulatory powers from the bank of england when it became independent in 1997 that would have prevented the escalation of debt that allowed british banks to become so over-exposed during the economic downturn.instead of admitting fault, coming to the house and saying, ""yes, we made some mistakes and we are now going to try to solve them"", the prime minister has tried over and over again to blame the united states. the only time he stopped doing that was, conveniently, during the g20 summit, when we had some guests who would probably have been a little bit upset to hear that old, incorrect argument being used so often. the minister is being most generous in giving way."
1674,6/4/2009,Conservative,conservative,Greg Hands,"a little earlier, he was claiming the credit for the independent bank of england's cut in interest rates, yet most businesses will not borrow at 0.5 per cent. on account of the continuing large credit spreads in the economy. gentleman knows, the bank of england was set up to be independent by the government and it has a clear remit to bear down on inflation."
1675,6/18/2009,Labour,labour,Ian Pearson,"we see no risks to inflation in the short or medium term, but these are matters for the bank of england.we are taking important action now to help business through these tough times. it is a global economic downturn, but each country is having to manage the effects in different ways, and the cause of that is the rules and regulations that are or are not in place in each country.what happened when this government came to power? they made the bank of england independent, and straight away the bank lost crucial powers to regulate the banks."
1676,6/18/2009,Conservative,conservative,Tobias Ellwood,"that was the first schoolboy error made by this government, and it led to the level of borrowing getting out of control; banks were lending people sums that they could not afford, in ways that they did not understand. i have it in command from her majesty the queen to acquaint the house that her majesty, having been informed of the purport of the bill, has consented to place her prerogative and interest, so far as they are affected by the bill, at the disposal of parliament for the purposes of the bill.i beg to move, that the bill be now read a second time.in 1997, the government embarked on an unprecedented programme of constitutional reform. power was devolved away from westminster to scotland, wales and northern ireland, fundamental rights were enshrined in the human rights act, freedom of information legislation was introduced, national statistics were placed on an entirely independent basis, the bank of england was made independent, and the first step was taken towards a reformed house of lords.surveying all this in an editorial yesterday,  the guardian newspaper asked us to""look at the last 12 years."
1677,10/20/2009,Labour,labour,Jack Straw,"labour's dispersal of power, had it been set out as a blueprint, would have appeared revolutionary.""actually, it was set out as a blueprint, although each step has always appeared rather prosaic. there then followed the bingham report into why the bank failed and why it was not properly supervised. lord justice bingham-as he then was-suggested that the supervision of banks should be taken away from the bank of england, and, indeed, the government, and placed in the hands of an independent regulator."
1678,11/18/2009,Labour,labour,Keith Vaz,"it may be the case that the regulator has not been up to speed, but surely the right hon. there are many bills that we partly support.i hope we will have the opportunity to table amendments to the financial services bill that reverse what happened to the bank of england. one reason why we are where we are with our finances is the changes undertaken in the first flourish of the current government: they gave independence to the bank of england, but took away that large and important element of bank supervision."
1679,11/19/2009,Conservative,conservative,Robert Syms,"the country lost a lot as a result, and the financial services authority has never fulfilled the same role with the confidence that the bank of england showed.it is interesting that we have a bill that promises the halving of our deficit. we have only three organisations responsible-the bank of england, the fsa and the treasury, which will always be involved where public money is.if the hon. gentleman thinks for one moment that merging the work of the fsa and the bank of england, under which the bank would be responsible for interest rate policy, macro-prudential supervision and the individual supervision of everything from large banks such as hsbc to an independent financial adviser in ullapool-doing all that at the same time-he is asking for trouble."
1680,11/25/2009,Labour,labour,Alistair Darling,"the disruption would be tremendous. no, there is a role for legislation to strengthen the fiscal framework. i am probably not too far from the conservative spokesman in his belief that we need an additional independent element in fiscal policy, as we have in monetary policy with the bank of england."
1681,11/26/2009,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"however, my party's approach would be more modest. it has been talked about as if that was the only thing that happened on that occasion, but it was not. the key factor was the bank of england being given independence and control over the setting of interest rates."
1682,11/30/2009,Labour,labour,Sally Keeble,"that was a phenomenally powerful tool to give the bank, which had previously been jealously preserved by the chancellor. gentleman again for his advice? he has not always been right: he advised me not to make the bank of england independent."
1683,12/3/2009,Labour,labour,Michael Connarty,"i am grateful to be called to speak in this debate. ] earlier this year, the chancellor was thinking aloud about the potential of an independent macro-prudential early warning system linking the bank of england to european central banks, and a single micro-prudential rule-making body."
1684,12/15/2009,Labour (Co-op),labour,David Taylor,"can the minister say what the state of play is in terms of those developments? beyond that""-commenting on the chancellor's plan-is a statement of intent and hope rather than a plan for which someone can be held accountable.""that is what he said in evidence to the treasury committee on 24 november 2009. i agree with the governor of the bank of england and that is our policy.it is increasingly clear, by the way, that virtually every independent and respected opinion in this country agrees with us rather than with the government of the day."
1685,1/5/2010,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"such opinion is also in agreement with our approach towards creating a fiscal framework in which we can be held accountable. this would constitute a proper, serious sanction. in extremis, the chancellor of the day can overrule the monetary policy committee or the independence of the bank of england, although of course the question never arises."
1686,1/5/2010,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"in this case, the chancellor of the exchequer would face a very difficult time if, after he or she had said, ""we will achieve this fiscal result over the coming years"", the independent body, at the time of the budget, said, ""actually, they will not."" there is, of course, a degree of uncertainty about the future path of growth for our economy. the independent forecast is different from the forecast that the chancellor presented, while his forecast is rather lower than that presented by the governor of the bank of england."
1687,1/7/2010,Labour,labour,Liam Byrne,"it would be difficult, especially this afternoon, for me to decouple these projections for the public finances and those presented for growth. it will be chaired by the chancellor, who is ultimately accountable to parliament, unlike some of the opposition's proposals. its role will not be to take binding decisions or to impose its will on an independent central bank and financial services regulator, but to work together with them to deliver financial stability objectives.i am disappointed, but not surprised, that the hon."
1688,1/25/2010,Labour,labour,Ian Pearson,"member for fareham (mr. it triggers the special resolution regime. the bank of england, as an independent central bank, is responsible for providing liquidity assistance to the banking system."
1689,1/25/2010,Labour,labour,Ian Pearson,"it has oversight of inter-bank payment systems and it is the resolution authority under the special resolution regime. actually, it will take a little longer, as it is a very worthy document. it proposes a""new system of financial regulation, with the bank of england back in charge of controlling the overall level of debt in the economy"",and a""new fiscal policy framework, with an independent office for budget responsibility"".the document also makes it clear that phase 1 of our approach will be the independent obr, and phase 2 an emergency budget within 50 days."
1690,2/25/2010,Conservative,conservative,Cheryl Gillan,"on phase 3, it says that""over the summer we will work flat out to conduct the detailed departmental spending review for the years after 2011"".i recommend the lecture for the hon. we would not get what we were given yesterday: the use of a growth forecast that exists only in the treasury. it is not the same as the one used by the bank of england, and it is certainly not the same as the one used by the independent forecasters who are currently examining the british economy.incidentally, if the budget had used the independent forecasters' estimate of growth next year rather than the treasury's estimate, Â£10 million would have been added to the borrowing requirement."
1691,3/25/2010,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"that is why we need an independent set of forecasts and an independent body to hold us-both parties-to the fiscal promises that we make and, as suggested by my hon. the fact is that the government have failed that task.it is not persuasive for the government to say, ""look, we have lower borrowing than we predicted."" after all, the institute for fiscal studies predicted in its green budget in january that the borrowing could be reduced to Â£167 billion for this year, but it went on to state that, even with the same level of growth as the government predicted, lower tax revenues would result, so much of the gains would be lost. the ifs also pointed out that the treasury's forecasts for economic growth were higher than the average of independent forecasts; indeed, we know that they are even higher than the bank of england projected."
1692,3/25/2010,Conservative,conservative,David Gauke,"there is consequently very little room for optimism as far as growth is concerned.we have heard a lot about tax rises. i think that the hon. gentleman will find that we had a decade of stability, with low interest rates and low inflation, because of the great leadership and prescience of an independent bank of england."
1693,3/30/2010,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"that was opposed by the right hon. clarke), who said that bank of england independence was a mistake and should not have been introduced. i expect that he has recanted now, but he can set the record straight when he speaks."
1694,3/30/2010,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"there is one exception: goldman sachs. the bank of england is also at the upper end of the range, but the overwhelming majority of independent forecasters believe that the government are far too optimistic.the second criticism is of how the government intend to achieve some of the cuts when they come. we had the real budget announced in press releases after the official statement in parliament last wednesday, in the form of these efficiency cuts."
1695,3/30/2010,Labour,labour,David Blunkett,"of course we introduced that system precisely because there was no financial regulation. we also made the bank of england independent, so that it could make judgments and intervene independently-and of course the opposition opposed that, too.the contradictions abound. we know that it is necessary to take care and time to determine what needs to be done."
1696,3/30/2010,Conservative,conservative,Tim Boswell,"heathcoat-amory) has also mentioned. in that committee, we discussed the independence of the bank of england and the restructuring of the regulatory system. on 4 december 1997, i moved a series of amendments that were intended to test the strength and integrity of the government's tripartite financial regulatory system, and we were told that it was all down to a memorandum of understanding."
1697,5/26/2010,Liberal Democrat,Others,David Laws,"i am grateful to you, mr speaker. i gently point out to the shadow chancellor that in 1997, the labour party announced its policy of bank of england independence not to this place but outside it. that was not even a policy that the labour party had stood on in its manifesto, so there is a very considerable difference with the proposals that we brought.let me also say to the shadow chancellor that it should be clear, in relation to his questions on schools, that we have protected the schools budget."
1698,5/27/2010,Conservative,conservative,George Young,"it was a discourtesy to the house and to her majesty, and steps will be taken to minimise the risk of such leaks occurring again.on the statement about cuts, i was surprised to hear the right hon. lady's comments, because she was a member of the house in 1997 when the then chancellor announced the independence of the bank of england four days after the election, before the house was sitting, and that was not even in the party's manifesto. he said that we needed to""tackle excessive fiscal budget deficits""and added:""i am very pleased that there is a very clear and binding commitment to accelerate the reduction in the deficit over the lifetime of the parliament and to introduce additional measures this fiscal year to demonstrate the importance of getting to grips with that before running the risk of an adverse market reaction.""how wise were those words and how welcome is such robustness from the governor of the bank of england."
1699,6/2/2010,Conservative,conservative,Michael Gove,"indeed, one newspaper columnist has argued:""that is why bank of england independence, once a controversial idea, is now accepted across all parties and by both sides of industry.""the columnist in question is, of course, the right hon. member for morley and outwood, writing in the  wakefield express. the nhs and international development were protected by the then shadow chancellor from spending cuts this year."
1700,6/2/2010,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"in his speech, the secretary of state tried to divert attention from the threat in future years to the schools and children's budgets by pointing to our economic record.for the record, first, it was our government who made the bank of england independent in the face of opposition from the conservatives, and took the tough decisions to get our national debt down lower than that of france, germany, japan and america before the financial crisis. secondly, it was our government who led the worldwide effort to stop a global financial collapse turning recession into depression, again in the face of bitter and wrong-headed opposition from the conservatives. in his conclusions, lord bingham recommended that that should not happen."
1701,6/9/2010,Labour,labour,Hugh Bayley,"many public bodies, such as the rdas the minister mentioned, but also the bank of england, the bbc, the judicial appointments commission and parliamentary boundary commissions, are independent of government precisely because they have to be independent of government. will the minister give the house a commitment that this will not just be a centralising exercise whereby bodies that ought to be independent are taken under direct control by ministers? we have got to make sure that, in what we do, we help those who try to do the right thing, to save and to look after themselves and their families."
1702,6/16/2010,Conservative,conservative,David Cameron,"the first thing that we have to do is keep control of inflation, keep the bank of england independent and ensure that the budget supports the tough approach on inflation, which is the worst thing for savers. the second thing that we can do is ensure that we do not discourage saving by having so many people reliant on a means test. friend is getting a reputation for making extremely good interventions, and that was one of them."
1703,7/20/2010,Conservative,conservative,Matthew Hancock,"fiscal consolidation also means that interest rates can be held lower for longer by the independent bank of england, which is a second important channel through which economic growth can be supported, and not opposed, by fiscal consolidation. i beg to move,that leave be given to bring in a bill to prohibit banks and building societies lending on the basis of demand deposits without the permission of the account holder; and for connected purposes.who owns the money in your bank account? the bank of england monetary policy committee sets interests rates, and does so independently."
1704,11/29/2010,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"the purpose, in part, of the measures that we have taken to reduce the deficit is to give the monetary policy committee the maximum possible flexibility and freedom in setting the appropriate monetary policy to stimulate demand in the economy. in many ways, our tripartite arrangements have been a success. as economists predicted before the change, bank of england independence aligned to inflation targets has allowed an independence, a clarity, a robustness and a rule-based approach."
1705,11/29/2010,Labour,labour,Alison McGovern,"it is important to recognise that. it will be able to challenge the prevailing consensus, and to ensure that potential risks are identified, monitored and addressed rather than being ignored, as they were under the last regime.the new architecture will also ensure that macro-prudential regulation of the financial system is co-ordinated effectively with the prudential regulation of individual firms, and that a new, more judgment-focused approach to regulation of firms is adopted so that business models can be challenged, risks can be identified, and action can be taken to preserve stability. that will be the responsibility of the new prudential regulation authority, which will be an independent subsidiary of the bank of england.however, it is not just a question of prudential stability."
1706,11/29/2010,Conservative,conservative,Mark Hoban,"as a number of members pointed out today, we also need to reform the way in which we look after the interests of consumers. nothing makes people up and down this land so angry as the knowledge that before the election both coalition partners promised tough action on bankers' bonuses, but the bob diamonds of this world and their gilt-edged friends still operate seemingly with impunity. people contrast that with members of the government who did not commit themselves to the austerity programme that is being brought in, but who are now presiding over a situation in which real wages will have dropped by 4% between 2009 and the end of this year, the governor of the bank of england is on record as warning of the biggest squeeze since the 1920s, and the office for budget responsibility, the government's own independent body, says that average pay for those on low and middle incomes will drop by Â£720 a year.people in work are making big sacrifices, and of course those who will lose their jobs as a result of the government's programme will lose out even more."
1707,2/2/2011,Labour,labour,Tony Lloyd,"when the governor of the bank of england says that that is the inevitable consequence of an economy that is rebalancing, we therefore have to say that we also need some rebalancing of the pay of those at the very top.the top-paid are doing not just very well but very much better than they were not so long ago. i also wish to thank the minister and the government for the open mind that they showed to labour amendments during the passage of the bill in the lords. i hope that she will show a similar approach to the amendments that we will table in committee.the creation of the obr seeks to apply to one narrow part of the uk's fiscal institutions some of the autonomy that labour brought to monetary policy when we made the bank of england independent-of course, we took steps to make the office for national statistics independent too."
1708,2/14/2011,Labour,labour,Angela Eagle,"as the house of commons library has pointed out, there are examples of similar bodies in other countries. friend agree that we have another independent forecaster, the bank of england, which was made independent in 1997? what lessons from the interaction between the treasury and that independent forecaster ought to be applied to the relationship between the treasury and the obr?"
1709,2/14/2011,Labour,labour,William Bain,"the bank already produces macro-economic forecasts. as the ifs again concludes:""those produced by the obr will be used when deciding fiscal policy, while those produced by the bank of england will be used by the mpc""-the monetary policy committee-""when deciding on monetary policy.""that might lead to a situation in which fiscal and monetary policy is not sufficiently well co-ordinated.on fiscal forecasts, progress has been made to underline the obr's independence in reaching its conclusions, but it needs to make as much data as possible, as well as the details of its financial models, available to the public. in evidence to the treasury committee recently, professor tim besley recommended that the obr should be able to communicate with key international bodies such as the international monetary fund, the eu and the oecd.the obr's mandate will not in itself generate higher growth, and that brings us to the proposed charter of fiscal responsibility to be created through clause 1."
1710,2/14/2011,Labour,labour,Alison McGovern,"gentleman asks an important question that cannot be dismissed by saying, ""oh, this is just people politicking."" understanding the business cycle is extremely difficult.when we consider the importance of rules-based economic policy, it is important to reflect on the fact that the office for budget responsibility is to fiscal policy what the independence of the bank of england was, and remains, to monetary policy-that is, it is an external-to-the-treasury body that is charged with an important economic function that will drive the policy prescriptions that the government make, in liaison and in discussion with, and working alongside, independent chairs and officials from the organisations concerned. i have no doubt that that is an extremely difficult job. as a chartered tax consultant and in the last six years as an mp, i watched a decade of budgets by the former prime minister and chancellor, the right hon."
1711,2/14/2011,Liberal Democrat,Others,Stephen Williams,"member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath (mr brown), whose first act as chancellor was to set up the independence of the bank of england, to which many hon. members have referred. if increased powers are given to the treasury committee to vet appointments, to scrutinise the work of the obr, particularly its funding, and to ensure that it has the necessary resources to do its job, thought needs to be given to whether the committee has the resources necessary to do that job.the hon."
1712,2/14/2011,Labour,labour,Kerry McCarthy,"member for bristol west (stephen williams) slightly lost me at the beginning with his talk about disraeli and fridge magnets, but then moved on to talk about bank of england independence, which he claimed was a liberal democrat manifesto- i am not denying it. the plans for the national audit office have received very little attention in this debate, because there is a general consensus that they are the right thing to do."
1713,2/14/2011,Labour,labour,Kerry McCarthy,"they are almost exactly in line with our plans for the national audit office that we set out in our constitutional reform and governance bill, which we did not get through the parliamentary process before the may 2010 election was called.we support the creation of the office for budget responsibility, which we see as continuing the direction of travel that we set in government by giving independence to the bank of england and the office for national statistics. however, we have a number of concerns about the details of the proposals. we hope that lessons will be learnt going forward."
1714,2/17/2011,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"the figures will be independently monitored by the bank of england and published quarterly. friend makes a helpful suggestion, and i will examine whether the figures can be disaggregated in that way. the bank of england ™s monetary policy committee is of course independent."
1715,3/22/2011,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"it is set a target by the chancellor, and i expect the bank to pursue that target. member for stone (mr cash) made a useful point about the eu ™s arrangements, under which acompletely independent central bank with no democratic controls sets interest rates that might or might not be appropriate for different nations. there are maastricht rules and a rigid currency that cannot be flexed by countries that need to do so."
1716,3/22/2011,Labour,labour,Ian Murray,"the recent reduction in gdp came as a shock to everyone, and serves to highlight some of the wishful thinking indulged in by those on the treasury bench.i think that everyone supports the establishment of the office for budget responsibility. one of the best measures taken by the labour government was the courageous step of making the bank of england independent. we have all seen the benefits of that, in good times as well as bad, as it can now make decisions for the benefit of the economy, rather than the benefit of the government.in the establishment in law of the obr, the bill should focus on more than just deficit and debt issues."
1717,3/22/2011,Labour,labour,Kerry McCarthy,i urge the economic secretary to ensure that the memorandum is subject to proper scrutiny in this house. i hope that the obr and the bank of england will in time formally agree their working relationship.we consider that a crucial way to secure the independence of the obr is to ensure transparency in its funding so that the budget responsibility committee is not at the mercy of the treasury and vulnerable to the whim of the chancellor. comparisons with other countries were made earlier.
1718,3/24/2011,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"i noticed that the chancellor did not choose to intervene with the answer that i was hoping for, but there we are. the fact is, when we came into government in 1997, we made the bank of england independent and he opposed it.we had a period of sustained growth and rising employment. the conservatives said that the national minimum wage would cost jobs, but employment went up."
1719,3/24/2011,Conservative,conservative,Jesse Norman,"on the question of evidence, is my right hon. friend aware that institutions as wide ranging as the institute for fiscal studies and the bank of england have calculated independently that we would be borrowing between Â£7 billion and Â£10 billion more if interest rates had been allowed to stay at the same level, without the fiscal austerity programme that was introduced by the chancellor? it is a pleasure to participate in this debate, and i am pleased to see so many hon."
1720,3/29/2011,Conservative,conservative,Tobias Ellwood,"knowing when to pull a lever and for how long affects the overall performance, the direction of travel and the comfort   or, indeed, the displeasure   of the passengers, who rely on a duty of care. there are four principal levers that we have for the economy: fiscal policy, which determines the managementof our deficit and our debt; monetary policy and interest rates, which are now set independently; the regulation of the financial sector and the relationship between the bank of england, the treasury, and the financial and business sectors; and finally, micro-economic policies   how we approach education, how to get a competitive tax system, and so on. we need to decide how to use all those levers at this delicate time, as we try to mend the economy."
1721,4/26/2011,Conservative,conservative,Matthew Hancock,"over many years, evidence grew in the academic economic debate that economic policy is best set for the long term, and the short-term dash for growth became discredited. in the  ™80s and  ™90s a consensus grew that fiscal policy should be set for the long term, and that monetary policy should be set through an independent bank of england and used to regulate demand in the shorter term   to keep inflation low and growth going. in fact, that became the cross-party consensus in the house."
1722,5/10/2011,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"i do not have a direct influence on monetary policy, but it is clear that by setting a credible fiscal policy, we give the mpc maximum room for manoeuvre and the freedom to keep interest rates lower for longer. the governor of the bank of england made that clear when he gave his mansion house speech last year, and it is an observation also made by many independent observers of the british economy. interest rates would be higher if we had a less credible fiscal policy."
1723,5/11/2011,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"although i am happy with the aims and principles of the charter, i would caution the minister that we should not place too much confidence in independence as the only virtue that is needed to get these things right. we have had an experiment with a so-called independent bank of england for more than a decade now and that has been our worst decade for boom and bust since the 1930s. that is not entirely the responsibility of the bank of england but it was part of the team that managed to preside over too much boom, too much credit and too much inflation and then over too little credit, too little liquidity and bankruptcies on a scale that none of us in this house had ever seen before."
1724,5/11/2011,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"that shows that independence is no guarantee of success.we also see from the bank of england that its inflation forecasts have been way out for quite some time    i am coming to the growth forecasts, if the hon. we have taken steps to put that right by putting the bank of england back at the pinnacle of that system, after the failure of the system put in place by the labour party."
1725,5/18/2011,Conservative,conservative,David Cameron,"on inflation, i strongly support monetary policy being independent and established by the bank of england. i do not want to go back to the bad old days of the treasury setting interest rates. friend the member for edinburgh south west (mr darling) has made a similar request, to which he did not seem to accede when he was chancellor of the exchequer."
1726,6/16/2011,Conservative,conservative,Mark Hoban,"the new regulatory regime does learn the lessons of the past, and the supervisory style and confused mandate of the fsa mean that we need to change.the lesson that we have learned from the financial crisis is that, importantly, the bank of england ™s expertise in market surveillance and in understanding macro-prudential trends can best work with the needs of a micro-prudential supervisor by ensuring that that micro-prudential supervisor is an independent subsidiary of the bank. and, just so the right hon. thank god that we did, because it has given us the mandate and the power to put the public finances back on track.the extraordinary thing about the shadow chancellor is that he takes credit for the things that went right."
1727,6/22/2011,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"on bank of england independence, he has completely written out of the script the then prime minister and chancellor. he now takes sole credit for keeping britain out of the euro, although, as far as i am aware   i am happy to take an intervention   the labour party ™s official policy is still that we join the euro in principle. lady will know that long-term interest rates hit an all-time low shortly after we made the bank of england independent."
1728,6/22/2011,Labour (Co-op),labour,Geraint Davies,"we experienced the biggest period of ongoing growth ever seen under the labour government, despite a number of crises in the world economy. he declined to do so, but i am sure that he will in due course. it is highly importantthat we get financial regulation correct; that is why we built the tripartite system, with an independent bank of england and an independent regulator separate from government.the question is: how do we make sure that we have the right powers of oversight?"
1729,6/22/2011,Labour,labour,Alison McGovern,"how do we ensure that we have government regulators who understand as much and more about the very complicated financial services sector that we have in a modern economy and who are able to have proper oversight? first, we are trying to protect our own country. of course, this was an independent decision of the bank of england, but when it made its decision it explicitly referenced what was happening in the eurozone as the principal reason for doing so."
1730,10/10/2011,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"secondly, we are very actively engaged with the eurozone in trying to find this international solution to its problems. gentleman ™s point about the rather remarkable vote by labour members against the imf is well made. as i said, it was an independent decision of the bank of england."
1731,10/10/2011,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"in the explanation that the governor gave of why the bank took the decision, he explicitly referred to the situation regarding the euro. i recommend to the house supporting the opposition ™s sensible amendment. the european central bank is independent; no one is able to tell it what to do."
1732,11/7/2011,Conservative,conservative,David Cameron,"there is a very strong case for saying that the eurozone institutions, including the ecb, need to do more to stand behind their currency and their currency zone, but we have to understand why the germans feel as strongly as they do, and it is partly based on their history and what they feel went wrong in the 1920s and  ™30s. we would all probably accept   i hope that the hon. member for streatham would accept   that the governor of the bank of england is an independent, non-partisan, non-political analyst of what has occurred."
1733,11/23/2011,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"let me read to him the governor ™s account given a week ago on why the slow-down in growth has occurred. britain ™s interest rates have been made lower as result. that has been achieved by the independent bank of england ™s purchasing policy, not because of the chancellor ™s fiscal measures."
1734,12/6/2011,Labour,labour,Tom Blenkinsop,"it is interesting to note that this self-given  œsafe haven status  by the chancellor has not led to increased international market ownership of british gilts. indeed, international market ownership of gilts has not changed from 2008 levels.quantitative easing is also a reason for that. when the independent bank of england buys gilts from banks and pension funds, some of the money is re-channelled into the sterling corporate bond market."
1735,12/6/2011,Labour,labour,Tom Blenkinsop,"that is great for the city, sterling and london property investment, but as yet there has been no trickle-down for regional small and medium-sized enterprises or regional high streets despite the much-hailed project merlin.what have been the consequences of the government ™s counter-intuitive policy for manufacturing and industry? his appointment fits into a pattern of improving the governance of our public agencies, and it is a principle that could properly be extended to other public agencies whose governance has been somewhat lacking of late. i think in particular of the bank of england, whose court needs comprehensive restoration; the treasury board, which could do with refreshment; and the governance of hm revenue and customs, which needs higher quality senior officials and non-executives.i conclude by congratulating the government on this appointment, and sir andrew dilnot on his acceptance, on his passion for statistics and on his independence of mind."
1736,12/13/2011,Conservative,conservative,Jesse Norman,"i welcome the energy, the integrity and the intelligence which he will bring to the evaluation of policy, i hope, as well as to the assessment of statistics and their presentation to the public. michael scholar, as all today ™s contributors have said, has done a splendid job of establishing that independence, and it is what we see in dilnot.there are still a few old lags in the house from the passage in 2007 of the statistics and registration service bill, which went through with hardly a flicker of interest; this is a crowded house compared with the number of people who attended back then. there was only one tiny piece of interest in the press, too, but it was an article that i repeated ad nauseum to the house at the time, because it stated that it was the most important bill of the labour government   we had been in power for 10 years   and would have a bigger effect than anything we had done, including handing over power and independence to the bank of england."
1737,12/13/2011,Labour,labour,Paul Flynn,"the article was written by a certain andrew dilnot, and his entire career has rightly been in that area   suggesting that statistics need to be independent.in the public administration committee, we all saw dilnot ™s boyish enthusiasm for statistics. the labour party has a five-point plan. for example, the vat change would stimulate Â£46 million in the local economy in swansea, helping to create new jobs, while lower national insurance rates would also be helpful in stimulating building businesses.i should mention that the interest rates that we now enjoy are thanks to the labour government making the bank of england independent."
1738,12/14/2011,Labour (Co-op),labour,Geraint Davies,"we remember the last time the tories were in, when interest rates hovered between 10% and 15%, so i will take no lessons from the conservatives about how the austerity plans and unemployment are the reason for low interest rates. in that same cross-party spirit, perhaps the chancellor would like to take this opportunity to apologise too: for the role his party played in opposition, and he played as shadow chancellor, in complaining of  œtoo much regulation , and for the then leader of the opposition calling, as late as spring 2008, for  œlower taxes  and  œless regulation  for the city. we all made mistakes and perhaps this chancellor, who opposed financial regulation legislation, who opposed the nationalisation of northern rock, rbs and lloyds, and who opposed bank of england independence, should show a little more humility as well."
1739,12/19/2011,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"if he does, i will, in a cross-party spirit, commend him for that.i join the chancellor in commending the excellent work of the pre-legislative scrutiny committee on the draft bill and of the treasury committee. post-1997, we created 2 million more jobs. we replaced interest rates of 10% to 15% with very low rates, thanks to the independence of the bank of england."
1740,1/23/2012,Labour (Co-op),labour,Geraint Davies,"with those jobs and those taxpayers, we doubled our investment in the health service and reduced debt. the total of household, corporate, financial and public sector debt in the uk reached a staggering 500% of gross domestic product. our banks became the most leveraged in the world, and whether it was northern rock ™s 120% mortgages secured on wholesale funding, halifax bank of scotland ™s catastrophic commercial property deals or the royal bank of scotland ™s reckless decision to buy abn amro after the markets had frozen, such things did not attract the intervention or, it seemed, the concern of britain ™s tripartite regulatory system.that system had been established as a by-product of the decision by the new labour government to give the bank of england independent control of monetary policy."
1741,2/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"without warning to the bank, or anyone else, that institution was stripped of its historic responsibility for regulating the banking system, which was given to a new financial services authority. as lord turner said in his review of the regulatory response to the banking crisis: œthe failure to do this analysis and to take action on it was one of the crucial failures of the years running up to the financial crisis.  perhaps the chancellor should remind the house that the shadow chancellor at the time also voted against bank of england independence."
1742,2/6/2012,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"in november 2006, the then shadow financial secretary, who is now financial secretary, said: œeffective light-touch, risk-based and principles-based regulation is in the interests of the sector globally.     [official report, 28 november 2006; vol. he said: œi believe that we are right to avoid prescriptive, heavy-handed regulation in britain. indeed, i believe that while it is bank of england independence that is regularly cited as the government ™s most significant financial reform, the establishment of the fsa has been as important for britain ,and that œit is important the fsa continues to deliver a light-touch and risk-based regulatory approach. we have ended up having a ding-dong across the dispatch box, but if he is against what we propose to do to change the system he created, will he vote against the bill tonight?"
1743,2/6/2012,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"i will set out our position in my speech, but the idea that by making the bank of england independent and adding a second deputy governor with responsibility for macro-prudential financial stability on both the monetary policy committee and the fsa board, the bank ™s role in macro-prudential stability is diminished or removed is plain wrong. the chancellor should not be allowed to state things that are outwith the facts. only the bank of england can put the necessary funds into the banking system ¦i asked treasury officials if there was a way of forcing the governor ™s hand."
1744,2/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"the fact that we had given the bank independence had a downside as well as an upside. of course my predecessor had, as any chancellor does, the general power of direction over the bank that the bank of england act 1946 provides, but that general power of direction has never been used, so it is a nuclear option that might blow up anyone who tries to use it. that was the conclusion that my predecessor reluctantly came to.that is unsatisfactory. however much legislation we write and however many clauses we put in place, those who do my job and that of the governor also have a very important responsibility to get on with each other and to try to make that arrangement work."
1745,2/6/2012,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"in a second.and yes, it was a failure shared here in the uk, across the treasury, the fsa, the bank of england   and i have to say the then opposition, too.let me remind the house that the legislation to give the bank of england independence, and to shift from self-regulation to statutory regulation after 1997, for the first time established a bank of england deputy governor with explicit responsibility for systemic financial stability and with an ex officio seat on the fsa board. as the seeds of the crisis were sown in the years before it, neither the fsa nor the bank of england nor the treasury rang the alarm bells, despite meeting every month in the tripartite standing committee.the chancellor, in a second breath a moment ago, said that we are now rightly taking the treasury out of making such decisions, having criticised the treasury for not triggering a crisis meeting that neither the bank of england nor the fsa asked for   a point that seemed to be deeply confused. gentleman wants to have a debate about who should apologise and who should accept responsibility, he should look at the evidence and the judgments of the past 10 years."
1746,2/6/2012,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"let us not forget that it was the conservative party that voted against bank of england independence and the move from self-regulation of the city by the city to statutory regulation for the first time in this country. it was this chancellor who personally opposed the rescue of northern rock, saying: œi am not in favour of nationalisation, full stop.     [official report, 19 february 2008; vol. friend ™s point, but to be honest i do not have strong views on that."
1747,2/6/2012,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"the reality is that there was not cross-party support or support more widely in civic society for bank of england independence when we established it. the conservatives voted against it. the point i would make is that i have always believed that it is better as a country to have both fiscal and monetary levers at our disposal, so that we have the most flexible way to respond to economic circumstances."
1748,3/5/2012,Conservative,conservative,David Cameron,"in britain, we are able to have tough measures to reduce our fiscal deficits, but at the same time, because we have an independent monetary policy, set by the bank of england, we are not constrained by being members of a currency bloc. that is why i oppose britain joining the euro   ever. i am today writing to the governor of the bank of england to reaffirm the consumer prices index inflation target of 2%."
1749,3/21/2012,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"the government ™s credible and responsible fiscal policy allows the independent central bank to pursue an activist monetary policy consistent with targeting low inflation. i confirm that the asset purchase facility will remain in place for the coming year.employment is growing, and inflation is coming down; so too is the deficit. in the short time available to me, i would like to speak directly to the point of monetary activism, which is one of the budget ™s key pillars."
1750,3/26/2012,Conservative,conservative,Steve Baker,"i hope the government will not take it as a criticism, because the chancellor has emphasised that the bank of england is independent and, of course, its policies are symptomatic of those followed all around the world.over the past 13 years under new labour, the money supply expanded from about Â£700 billion in 1997 to Â£2.2 trillion in 2010. that was through a massive expansion of bank balance sheets   a huge amount of monetary activism led by central banks, with the bank of england keeping interest rates too low for too long. this was particularly the case because a large chunk of the fiscal consolidation in 2010 and in 2011 took the form of a vat increase, which has a high multiplier for households. in other words, by hitting households as hard as they did, sapping confidence and sucking demand out of the economy, the chancellor and his ready accomplice, the chief secretary, have got the uk stuck in the slow lane while other key players in the global economy are overtaking us."
1751,4/18/2012,Labour,labour,Chris Bryant,"broadly speaking, yes, i do, just as i supported making the bank of england independent at a time when the conservative party was opposed to doing so. however, my point remains that this house does not really vote properly through the expenditure of the government; we do not, in any sense, analyse it line by line. friend says."
1752,4/23/2012,Labour,labour,Kelvin Hopkins,"when the bank of england was given its independence   so-called   i thought that if it started to fly in the face of what was obviously sensible for the economy, a government might choose to take that independence back to the treasury and into the hands of the chancellor. if the bank is not sensible in respect of managing the economy as a whole, is it not possible that a government might choose to take back that independence and operate policy from the treasury? given the vast responsibilities of the governor, the case for this committee to have a power of veto over the appointment or dismissal of the governor is even stronger than it is with respect to the obr."
1753,4/23/2012,Labour,labour,John McDonnell,"we therefore recommend that, in order to safeguard his or her independence, the treasury committee is given a statutory power of veto over the appointment and dismissal of the governor of the bank of england. i wholeheartedly supported that view. the chancellor ™s argument was that the treasury committee could not have such a role because the governor was exercising an executive function and should therefore be a government appointee. that is an absolutely specious argument.the legislation to give independence to the bank of england went through the house, although i never supported it."
1754,4/23/2012,Labour,labour,John McDonnell,"that means that the governor has more than an executive function. the chancellor of the exchequer and the government cannot have it both ways. if they support the independence of the bank of england from the government, they must establish some other form of accountability to parliament."
1755,4/23/2012,Labour,labour,John McDonnell,"if they do not believe that it is independent, and that it is simply an executive arm of the government, the governor will be appointed directly by the chancellor of the exchequer. friend has a point. like him, i was unhappy about the decision to hand power over monetary policy to the bank of england and give it independence."
1756,4/23/2012,Labour,labour,Kelvin Hopkins,"all aspects of macro-economic management ought to be matters for ministers accountable to parliament. that is causing problems in many ways. however, if there were a sensible, managed deconstruction of the euro, with the re-creation of national currencies in many, or possibly all, of those countries, thereby allowing them to reflate their economies, they would benefit, as would we, and the whole european union would then start to work properly   as a group of democratic, independent nations co-operating voluntarily for mutual benefit, rather than something driven by people in central banks or people in brussels in the commission."
1757,5/14/2012,Labour,labour,Chuka Umunna,"i am not saying that the governor of the bank of england was wrong. i have an advantage over many members, in that i came into the house in 1997. within a matter of hours, the then labour government decided to make the bank of england independent."
1758,5/14/2012,Conservative,conservative,Robert Syms,"they also changed the regulatory regime for the whole banking system from its historic basis in which the bank of england presided over the banks. the financial policy committee was set up to look at risks on both the downside and the upside. the financial services authority must make its own independent decisions, but i am sure that it will have paid close attention to my speech and to the speech of the governor of the bank of england at the mansion house."
1759,6/26/2012,Liberal Democrat,Others,Danny Alexander,"lady refers to just one of a number of shambolic statements made by the scottish national party since it launched its campaign for independence a few weeks ago, and not just on the bank of england, but on financial services regulation. she makes the point very powerfully indeed that scotland is  œbetter together  as part of the united kingdom. all that would be jeopardised if scotland were ever to become independent."
1760,6/28/2012,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"of course, it is important that the regulator, including the bank of england, is accountable to parliament for its actions, and has to answer for its actions, while at the same time   and i think that there is cross-party support for this   we maintain the independence of the monetary policy committee and the governor in his role. the financial services bill includes many new tools to increase accountability to parliament and to the public. for example, last year the ministry of justice announced that the appointment of the information commissioner would not be made if the justice select committee opposed it."
1761,7/6/2012,Labour,labour,John McDonnell,"the proposal in today ™s bill, then, is nothing new or revolutionary but simply part of the evolving relationship between parliament and the executive.in line with the evolutionary progress in that relationship, when the treasury committee undertook its investigation into the accountability of the bank of england, the report of which was published in october 2011, it examined parliamentary involvement in the appointment and dismissal of the governor and concluded: œthe power of veto with respect to the obr was given to ensure the independence and accountability of that body. the governor of the bank ™s independence from government is crucial for his or her credibility. friend the member for preseli pembrokeshire (stephen crabb) who was the duty whip at the time, said something like,  œthat was one of the dullest speeches i have ever heard; more time limits, please !"
1762,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Stephen Hammond,i hope the whips will find my speech today to be equally dull; perhaps there is a case for time limits in debates such as this.it might bring a little colour to the debate as well as a sense of purpose if we look at one or two of the governors of the bank of england over the last century who have been extremely powerful figures on the economy and powerful figures in respect of their independence from government. we could reflect on how theirappointments were made. i just wonder what the treasury select committee might have said to him when he was appointed.
1763,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Mark Hoban,"to clarify, let me point out that the financial conduct authority is not part of the bank of england; it is an independent body. failure to understand that is a mistake that the hon. friend ™s greater knowledge of this matter."
1764,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Stephen Hammond,"my key point was that the bank of england and its family, cousins and outside friends will now have a much greater role at the centre of the regulation of our financial system and, indeed, of our overall economy.it is in some ways understandable that the immediate drive of the bill before us is to increase the powers of parliamentary accountability, but i think there is some confusion between accountability and independence. parliament will gain further powers of control, scrutiny and accountability under the financial services bill. it is right for parliament to have greater accountability and greater scrutiny, but we need to be clear that the governor, who is at the centre of the operation of macro-economic policy and macro-financial and prudential control, must be independent.the bill before us contains not only a power of veto but a power of appointment, which could be seen as a step backwards in the whole argument about independent policy making."
1765,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Stephen Hammond,"the bank of england act 1998 took a momentous step forward in respect of the independence of the bank and the governor by giving the power of decision over interest rates to the monetary policy committee. that was, and will remain, the historic achievement of the labour government. friend believe that the conduct of monetary policy from 1998 to 2008 was any better than it was when the bank of england was not independent and when previous conservative governments from 1979 onwards were interfering in monetary policy very considerably?"
1766,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Stephen Hammond,"again, my hon. friend and i could enjoy a happy morning discussing monetary policy, but, as i have said, i will not go down that line.the protections and requirements introduced by the financial services bill seem to me to be exactly the same as those introduced by the bank of england in terms of independence. what concerns me is that if the treasury committee can hold the bank responsible for its actions in the past as well as its immediate decisions, it does not necessarily need a power of veto over the governor ™s appointment."
1767,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Stephen Hammond,the committee is already able to attend pre-commencement hearings with appointees to the monetary policy committee and will be able to do the same in future with appointees to the financial policy committee. obviously that could potentially involve agreement with the government.let me return to the issue of the independence of both the person and the institution of the governor of the bank of england from the treasury committee. as i am not in the position of my hon.
1768,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Stephen Hammond,"we shall have to wait and see whether my hon. friend chooses to make such a move later in the debate.it seems to me that there are three crucial points to be made about the independence of the institution of the governor of the bank of england. let me begin by saying that if the governor were indeed appointed by the treasury committee, which would have the right of veto, the institution could be perceived to be tainted if the appointment reflected the politics or the political make-up of the committee."
1769,7/6/2012,Labour (Co-op),labour,Christopher Leslie,"that recommendation came from the treasury committee, yet there was resistance from the government. it is now not unreasonable to want to improve and enhance the external checks and balances on the bank of england and i do not think that would in any way compromise the independence of the operational monetary policy decisions over interest rates. i do not think that those things are at all incompatible.it would have been nice if the financial services bill could have been amended in the lords in such a way, but the government resisted that."
1770,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Brandon Lewis,"his reason for introducing the bill is to ensure that there is full and proper scrutiny and an open and transparent approach to the appointment of such an important position, but i fear that that is the only principle on which, for this morning at least, the hon. gentleman and i are likely to agree.the bill threatens us with direct parliamentary interference in the appointment of the governor of the bank of england and, through that, unnecessarily jeopardises the wider political independence of the bank. i want to address two particular elements of how the bill approaches the problem, on which some comment has already been made."
1771,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Brandon Lewis,"as was said earlier, we in the house know that the integrity of members of select committees is strong enough and powerful enough to deal with that properly, but what matters is not necessarily what we in the house think on the role of the governor of the bank of england, but what people outside think, and what the markets think. it is the perception that becomes the reality, and we need the markets to have confidence and faith in the governor and in his ability and independence, which the house can scrutinise.why stop with the governor the bank of england? the bill ™s purported aim is to preserve the governor ™s independence; to remove the appointment from political considerations and pressures."
1772,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Brandon Lewis,"any concerns they have about the bank ™s enhanced role under the financial services bill focus on whether those functions are open to proper public scrutiny through parliament. the inalienable political independence of the bank of england is something that we, as member of the house of commons, should cherish, defend and uphold, which i think we do. when the former chancellor of the exchequer, the right hon."
1773,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Brandon Lewis,"if he had done so, the political uproar would have been enormous. the media and other commentators would and, no doubt rightly, could have criticised it as a blatant attempt at political interference, and, as members will know, we had a debate along those lines just yesterday.i urge members to create no similar furore through this bill, which blatantly attempts to assert direct parliamentary control over the appointment of the politically independent governor of the bank of england. such unnecessary interference risks turning the appointment into a political football between the executive and the legislature, which our financial markets would not tolerate or consider a sensible way forward."
1774,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Jo Johnson,"that was precisely what happened in 2009, when paul tucker became deputy governor, and this government, like the previous government, have agreed that that eminently sensible practice will continue.the process of increasing accountability has carried on under this government. provisions in the financial services bill for a non-renewable eight-year term, rather than the current system of a renewable five-year term, combined with internal reform of the banks ™ board arrangements, will further reinforce the governor ™s independence from the government and the quality of oversight undertaken by the court of the bank of england. the accountability deficit, which definitely existed, has therefore narrowed considerably over the past 15 years, and it will close still further if the bill is enacted."
1775,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Matthew Hancock,"i did so yesterday. however, the broad and settled view of the house is that we should retain the current situation.because the central bank is the monopoly provider of money and the lender of last resort, it must share a common strategy with the government even though it is vital that its operational decisions on interest rates and financial stability are independent. the current appointment process fulfils well the twin objectives of operational independence and broad agreement on strategy."
1776,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Jacob Rees-Mogg,"i agree with my hon. friend that there have been many occasions in history   a few of which i may quote later   when governors have shown themselves to be hostile to government policy, but i wonder whether that is an argument against independence of central banks, rather than against the ratification of the appointment of central bankers. my argument is in favour of the operational independence of central banks    œfreedom in a framework , if i may put it that way, or  œconstrained discretion , as economists inelegantly call it."
1777,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Matthew Hancock,"the argument is that the broad strategy should be agreed on and put in place. within that strategy and agreed framework, independence allows the bank of england   or the institution making operational decisions   to look past shorter-term considerations and the impact of their decisions on twitter and the next day ™s headlines, and thereby take the political cycle out of the political economy of a decision affecting the country over a long period.my analysis of the past tells us something important about central banks now. the point is that they should never be forced to do the government ™s bidding in the areas delegated to them."
1778,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Matthew Hancock,"the funding for lending scheme and the liquidity scheme, which i think is one of the most vital elements of our economic recovery, are a joint matter involving use of the treasury ™s balance sheet and the indemnity for the bank of england, and bank of england action in the markets, both between banks and in the context of the wider availability of debt. that is a clear indication of the requirement for not just operational independence, but a common strategy between the governor of the bank and the government of the day.allowing banks to borrow from the bank of england in order to lend directly into the real economy means having to ensure that the high rates paid by one bank to another because of the insecurity of, ultimately, their creditworthiness and the difficulty of accessing liquidity are not passed on to people who pay for mortgages or businesses that need to borrow to finance investment. many businesses that have taken advantage of opportunities, and many mortgagees who have bought houses, are capable of repaying a loan directly at a decent interest rate that is worth while to them, but a margin is added because the banks cannot lend to each other at decent rates that are almost free of risk.the involvement of the government in liquidity is nothing new."
1779,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Matthew Hancock,"it has not happened for about 15 years, but for several centuries before that, the bank of england intervened in the provision of liquidity in the city through the discounted bill market. liquidity was available to ordinary businesses, and indeed to people wanting to buy their homes, when it was supported by the bank of england, normally as the  œthird name  on a bill, in order precisely to ensure that the monetary policy of the central bank   whether independent or not   got into the real economy and did not end up stuck in the banking system, as happens too often today.as the current governor of the bank of england said in his mansion house speech, œthe long term nature of the lending and its pricing mean that the bank could conduct such an operation only with the approval of the government, as offered by the chancellor ¦such a scheme would be a joint effort between bank and treasury. if, as set out in the bill, the treasury committee could veto somebody who had a strategic agreement with the government, and in their place ensure that only somebody who agreed with its strategy, and not the government ™s, went into the job, that would undermine this potential for joint working. it is to do with the appointment and dismissal of the governor, and my argument is that the broad strategy of the governor must be aligned with the broad economic strategy of the government, and that this bill could render the two asunder.what is currently happening in the eurozone serves as a definitive example of the problems that can arise when the views of governments and of the leadership of a central bank diverge, and it shows what could happen if this bill were to be enacted."
1780,7/6/2012,Conservative,conservative,Kwasi Kwarteng,"one of the more interesting speeches today related to the origins of the bank, because we have to understand where it has come from, and i repudiate any attempt to curtail members ™ right of speech when they are describing the history of the bank. everything is contingent: one has to understand the history of institutions to understand better how we can develop them.the bank of england was for almost 270 years an independent institution. it was a private bank, and its governor would spend two years ™ in the role on a rotating basis."
1781,7/10/2012,Conservative,conservative,Rory Stewart,"certain powers are taken away from the house and given to non-elected people as part of our democracy. for example, the labour government were proud to take away control of interest rates from parliament and to give it to an independent central bank. government members were proud to take control of economic forecasting away from this place and give it to the office for budget responsibility."
1782,7/12/2012,Labour,labour,Emma Reynolds,"friend that the protection of the human rights of the roma community is incredibly important and that those rights are at risk in hungary. their human rights have been threatened in other member states, too   i will not mention a former president of the french republic and some of the things he said about that community.the fundamental law extends the hungarian government ™s control over various bodies that should be independent, such as the central bank and the courts. in particular, there are concerns about the independence of the judiciary."
1783,9/11/2012,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"friend is right: low interest rates are secured by credible, economic and fiscal policy, and delivered by the independent bank of england. sir mervyn king has been an outstanding governor of the bank, and has helped set monetary policy to support our economy through one of its most challenging periods in modern history. as we know from remarks by the commission, the president of the eu council and the fco, that would not be the case for any state seeking accession or re-accession.croatia had to make speedy progress in several areas of the accession process, demonstrating the standard that the eu expects of new aspirant member states or   dare i say it   parts of member states that decide to separate and form new entities that might seek entry to the eu."
1784,11/6/2012,Labour,labour,William Bain,"this debate is instructive, therefore, not only because of what croatia had to do to satisfy the entry criteria or what other aspirant states, such as serbia or turkey, might have to do in the future, but in terms of what scotland might have to do to become a member state if it votes for separation in 2014.the first area where croatia had to make significant reforms was in relation to the creation of an independent central bank. the eu council issued a draft common position on the progress of the access negotiations with croatia in 2009 in which it commented extensively on the advances made in the administrative capacities and remit of croatia ™s central bank, the hnb. it cannot be a criterion, then, for future accession or re-accession countries to fail to have a system to protect bank deposits."
1785,11/6/2012,Labour,labour,William Bain,"that is the implication that comes from croatia ™s accession process and which is reflected in the bill.the obvious question arises   the fco mentioned this in a statement on thursday   of how, if part of the eu were put into limbo, it could possibly meet the terms of such an eu directive, having no independent central bank, no machinery to guarantee bank deposits and having to rely on the central bank of another state to guarantee bank deposits. those are all implications that come from croatia ™s accession process.the lessons of the negotiations for any new aspirant state highlight the following issues: does it have its own financial services regulator or would it seek to continue with the current regulatory framework, which would be conducted by another state? i join him in thanking the outgoing governor of the bank of england, sir mervyn king, for his public service and i wish him a long and happy retirement."
1786,11/26/2012,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"i commend the chancellor on his choice of successor, mr mark carney, to be the third governor of the bank of england since our decision to make it independent in 1997. we on this side of the house look forward to working with him closely in the coming months and years.i have known mark carney for a number of years and have worked with him closely. gentleman again."
1787,11/26/2012,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"i sincerely thank him for that.one of the important things about the independence of the bank of england, which the right hon. gentleman helped to establish with the previous prime minister, is that it commands cross-party support   it did not at the time; it does now   and we must try to keep the appointment of the governor out of the day-to-day partisan debate. i do not know which young adviser of his put that idea into his mind."
1788,11/26/2012,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"[interruption.] with transparent and independently audited public finances, an excellent central bank governor and new responsibilities for the bank of england, we have a better framework than the one that we inherited. i am almost tempted to wish that there was no time limit, because the hon. i cannot see a scotland in the same situation being any different, even if i believed that that was the intention."
1789,11/29/2012,Labour,labour,Frank Doran,"however, what we know so far   about the monarch, the pound sterling, the bank of england as the reserve bank and being part of the eu   does not sound very much like independence to me. i am very concerned by my hon. perhaps i should welcome that, because i might have fitted very nicely into a 1950s vision of the establishment, but i am surprised that this house by and large wishes to see that return."
1790,12/3/2012,Conservative,conservative,Jacob Rees-Mogg,"the report suggests that appointment should take place in œan independent, fair and open way    like the appointment of the new governor of the bank of england, i am tempted to say, although i thought it was an excellent appointment. it was advertised for the first time, lots of good and qualified people applied and then the chancellor appointed who he wanted to in the first place. it matters because the government are giving phenomenal new powers to the bank of england within our economy as an overarching financial regulator."
1791,12/10/2012,Labour (Co-op),labour,Christopher Leslie,"the minister says that the pra is independent and will report to parliament, but let us be honest: this is a creature of the bank of england and the bank will control very much what happens in the regulatory framework. although we welcome the concession that was made to create an oversight committee, peoplehave misgivings   we will probably hear about some of them, perhaps from members of the treasury committee, in a moment   that there is still a very hierarchical and centralised set of governance structures in the bank of england.we therefore need to make sure that this crucial verb  œoversee  is included in the oversight committee ™s remit. friend for being so generous in giving way again."
1792,12/10/2012,Labour,labour,Alison McGovern,"this is a crucial point: parliament rarely discusses the strategic role of the bank of england and rarely legislates, in part because the independence of the bank of england is still a valid economic principle on which we hope to rebuild our economy. we must therefore get the discussion right at this time. it is worth noting that when we talk about the independence of the bank of england we are talking about operational decisions of the monetary policy committee."
1793,12/10/2012,Labour (Co-op),labour,Christopher Leslie,"they have to be made, of course, without political interference. if anyone can follow, and indeed have imprinted in his mind, every clause of fsma, and be able to relate it to any future amendment, i know that he is capable of it. let me first respond to some of the points made in the debate, including his.the bank of england is obviously at the heart of the financial system, and the changes are among the important reforms of its powers in history, alongside nationalisation in 1946 and independence in matters of monetary policy in 1998."
1794,12/10/2012,Conservative,conservative,Greg Clark,"notwithstanding the few remaining issues of debate, i think that the whole house would agree that the changes made in the lords represent a significant improvement in this part of the bill. one of the big features of the post-crisis economies has been the way in which governments have had to pursue fiscal consolidation   because of the inheritance they received, and ours was worse than most   alongside supportive monetary policy. i made my maiden speech in 1997 in support of the then chancellor when he made the bank of england operationally independent."
1795,3/21/2013,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"that was an important and good reform. if money is pumped into the economy at that rate, that is bound to create asset price bubbles. an independent bank of england therefore found itselfcontrolling the money supply by looking at price inflation without looking at house prices, which were rushing away."
1796,3/22/2013,Conservative,conservative,Steve Baker,"that was bound to end in catastrophe.let me explain the problem with the chancellor ™s policy on credit market intervention. do not misunderstand me: there has been a problem with the general public ratcheting up more private debt through the availability of low interest rates, which in themselves are a good thing, thanks to the fact that my right hon. friend the member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath (mr brown) introduced bank of england independence and all the rest of it, and thanks to a feeling that there would be a continuation of growth."
1797,4/17/2013,Labour (Co-op),labour,Geraint Davies,"people were investing in houses and they were growing in price and so on.since 2010, when the chancellor said,  œwe will have half a million people unemployed in the public services  and did not say who they were or when they would lose their jobs, there has been a sharp rise in savings rates and a fall-off in consumer demand. although i strongly support the sovereignty of this parliament, for some matters the outcome for consumers can be improved when they are given to an independent or european body. we give authority to the independent central bank   the bank of england   because evidence and theory has shown that an independent body can set interest rates in a more effective way."
1798,5/15/2013,Liberal Democrat,Others,Ed Davey,"the analysis, not just in this country and europe but in america, is that an independent competition body is the most effective way. however, one is left with the impression that although some of the measures may be worthwhile, as a whole they are not equal to the depth and durability of our economic problems. in fact, the government seem to have given up and are waiting desperately for the new governor of the bank of england to secure the economic growth that they have so signally failed to secure.the queen ™s speech seems to be more about positioning and fear of the uk independence party than about genuinely dealing with the country ™s economic problems."
1799,5/15/2013,Labour,labour,Pat McFadden,"ukip, however, is a movement against the political establishment as a whole. we all remember black wednesday. we made the bank of england independent to keep interest rates low.the opposition are serious about keeping interest rates low and having fiscal discipline, but our priority is economic growth."

regulator must either   (a) with the consent of the treasury, give each of the persons a second preliminary notice, or(b) give each of them a notice stating that it has decided not to exercise its group restructuring powers.(6) a second preliminary notice is a notice stating   (a) that the regulator proposes to exercise the group restructuring powers, and(b) the manner in which it proposes to do so.(7) the second preliminary notice must specify a reasonable period (which may not be less than 14 days) within which any of the relevant persons may make representations to the regulator about the proposals.(8) the regulator must after considering any representations made in response to the second preliminary notice give each of the relevant person s a third preliminary notice stating   (a)

before the end of the warning notice period, give each of them a notice stating that it has decided not to exercise the powers.(2) the  œwarning notice period  is the period of 6 months beginning with the first anniversary of the day on which the third preliminary notice was given.(3) before giving a warning notice under subsection (1)(a), the appropriate regulator must    (a) give the treasury a draft of the notice,(b) provide the treasury with any information that the treasury may require in order to decide whether to give their consent, and(c) obtain the consent of the treasury.(4) the action specified in the warning notice may be different from that specified in the third preliminary notice if   (a) the appropriate regulator considers that different action is appropriate as a result of any change in circumstances since the third preliminary notice was given, or(b) the person concerned consents to the change.(5) the regulator must, in particular, have regard to anything that   (a) has been done by the person concerned since the giving of the third preliminary notice, and(b) represents action that would have been required in pursuance of the proposals in that notice.(6) if the regulator decides to exercise the group restructuring powers it must give each of the relevant persons a decision notice.(7) the decision notice must allow at least 5 years from the date of the decision notice for the completion of   (a) any disposal of shares, securities or other property that is required by the notice, or(b) any transfer of liabilities for which the notice requires arrangements to be made.(8) the giving of consent for the purpose of subsection (4)(b) does not affect any right to refer to the tribunal the matter to which any decision notice resulting from the warning notice relates.(9)  œthe relevant persons  has the same meaning as in section 142jc.142je references to tribunal(1) a notified person who is aggrieved by   (a) the imposition by either regulator of a requirement as a result of section 142jb(2)(a) or (b) or (3)(a) or (b),(b) a requirement to be imposed as a result of the giving by one regulator to the other of a direction under section 142jb(2)(c) or (3)(c), or(c) the giving by either regulator of a direction under section 142jb(2)(d) or (3)(d),may refer the matter to the tribunal.(2)  œnotified person  means a person to whom a decision notice under section 142jd(6) was given or ought to have been given.142jf subsequent variation of requirement or direction(1) a regulator may at any time with the consent of the person concerned vary   (a) a requirement imposed by it as a result of section 142jb(2)(a) or (b) or (3)(a) or (b), or(b) a direction given by it as a result of section 142jb(2)(c) or (d) or (3)(c) or (d).(2) the person concerned may at any time apply to the appropriate regulator for the variation of   (a) a requirement imposed by it as a result of section 142jb(2)(a) or (b)or (3)(a) or (b), or(b) a direction given by it as a result of section 142jb(2)(c) or (d) or (3)(c) or (d).(3) sections 55u, 55v, 55x and 55z3 apply to an application under subsection (2) as they apply

1802,7/8/2013,Labour (Co-op),labour,Christopher Leslie,"the purpose of the debate today is to look at the potential parallel to be drawn there, with a target being set and operational independence for the implementation of that target being given to the financial policy committee and the bank of england. over every three-month period the fpc should respond by notifying any changes and any actions that it has taken in order to regulate leverage, so that there is a dialogue and a process that is fairly self-explanatory. the main point is that leverage should be recognised as a key dynamic in our economy and needs to be regulated in a way not dissimilar to the regulation of inflation.for us, there are three essential elements: set a leverage target for the system as a whole, which is a task for the government; measure that risk   the threats to whether loans are going to be repaid   more accurately by sector, to determine which sector needs more capital to make it safe if leverage is rising and which could dealt with in a normal way; stress-test to back-test the pressures in those particular institutions to be clear that the choice of the leverage target is correct."
1803,7/8/2013,Labour (Co-op),labour,Christopher Leslie,the regulator should do that.new clause 9 would also augment bank of england independence in relation to operational decisions on monetary policy and take into account the need to supply credit to the wider economy. i am glad that the building societies association and others support it.i know that other members wish to speak and so will not take much more time. i think that a government have to take responsibility for the big calls on economic policy.
1804,7/8/2013,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"they can take very good advice from independent regulators and the bank of england, and sensible chancellors take good advice, but ultimately it is the chancellor of the exchequer and the prime minister of the day who have their names on all that, and the electorate will expect them to be responsible. i think that people believe in independent central banks and independent regulators up to the point where they get it wrong, and then they look to politicians to take the blame. we have just been through a period when the banking regulator, by its own admission, got it very visibly wrong."
1805,9/11/2013,Liberal Democrat,Others,Michael Moore,"the nationalists fail to answer all the points from both sides of the argument. if scotland chooses to vote for independence next september, how will handing over control of the scottish economy to a foreign bank, namely the bank of england, benefit scotland ™s economy? it is a pleasure to follow the hon."
1806,11/19/2013,Conservative,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"that is the framework that provides the environment in which businesses can invest, grow, export and create jobs. it is not politicians who create that wealth and those jobs, but we can damage the cost of living and the growth of businesses with bad monetary policies, high taxes, irresponsible borrowing, excessive regulation and the high interest rates that we saw under the previous government.the decision to make the bank of england independent in 1997 was just about the only decision made by the right hon. member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath(mr brown) with which i agreed."
1807,12/10/2013,Conservative,conservative,Sajid Javid,"friend is well versed in these matters and makes a significant contribution to the debate on monetary policy. he will know, therefore, that monetary policy is determined by the independent bank of england, but i will ensure that governor carney is made aware of his concerns. in some cases, the  œdeal , as the hon."
1808,12/18/2013,Liberal Democrat,Others,Alistair Carmichael,"that is part of their strategy. they identify things such as the pound, the bank of england and the ability to build complex warships on the clyde, which are the things that the people of scotland value from being part of the united kingdom, and then pretend that they can hold on to them while becoming independent. it is just not credible, which is why they are losing the argument."
1809,1/15/2014,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"it is a little difficult to do so in the face of the relentless tribalism that we have just heard, but i would say at the outset that the introduction of the national minimum wage was a real achievement of the previous government. there were not many achievements, but two will stand the test of time: the establishment of the independent bank of england and the establishment of the national minimum wage.  [interruption.] indeed, there were others, but those were the two main ones in the economic field.having said that, i attempted to be constructive about the motion, but one blindingly obvious point is that the centrepiece of the national minimum wage legislation   the establishment of a non-partisan, non-political low pay commission   did not even merit a mention."
1810,2/6/2014,Liberal Democrat,Others,Robert Smith,"gentleman is putting an emotional case for independence, but he is not taking on board the wise words of the governor of the bank of england who talked about the illusion of independence if an independent scotland keeps the pound sterling. the voice of scotland will be taken away from the decisions that will affect its very core monetary policy. that is the effect of the discipline of the eurozone.scotland could, of course, go for the sterling currency union   the latest wheeze   which is a mini copy of the eurozone with the fiscal interests of control in the larger economy."
1811,2/6/2014,Labour,labour,Michael Connarty,"mark carney, the governor of the bank of england, delivered the home truths in edinburgh and was quoted in the financial times: œthe desire of the scottish government to remaining the sterling area would, he stressed, sharply curtail scotland ™s fiscal and financial independence. it is quite clear that the bigger country would dictate the policies of the smaller country.at the moment there are massive subsidies from england and its taxpayers for wind farms. our renewables are being brought up in the uk, and they are paid for by the uk. i cite their abstention on the welfare reform bill, which introduced the cruel and dreaded bedroom tax; their abstention on a cut in the top rate of income tax; and their refusal to support any measure to help to promote measures to provide the welsh government with the economic powers that they need to move the welsh economy forward."
1812,2/13/2014,Labour (Co-op),labour,Mark Lazarowicz,"the house will be aware that the governor of the bank of england recently made some important comments on the currency issue if scotland were to become independent, and it will be aware that other statements are to be made about that today. would it not be a good idea for the national audit office to commission independent studies on the effects of currency decisions in relation to independence, which would certainly illuminate the debate both in scotland and the rest of the uk? what recent discussions he has had with the governor of the bank of england on a currency union with an independent scotland."
1813,3/11/2014,Liberal Democrat,Others,Danny Alexander,"both the chancellor of the exchequer and i have regular discussions with the governor of the bank of england on a wide range of issues on the uk economy. a currency union would not work for the rest of the uk or for an independent scotland. monetary policy is, rightly, the preserve of the independent bank of england."
1814,3/11/2014,Liberal Democrat,Others,Danny Alexander,"i would also point the hon. alex salmond claims that an independent scotland will still use the pound. given that there is no likelihood of a currency union between the remainder of the united kingdom and any future independent scotland and that scotland would therefore not have the backing of the lender-of-last-resort facility of thebank of england, does my right hon."
1815,3/19/2014,Conservative,conservative,Mel Stride,"friend agree that such a path is disastrous for scotland   particularly its financial and banking sector? does it not tell us all we need to know about those arguing for independence that when the governor of the bank of england, in an impartial and carefully produced speech, draws attention to the reservations he has about a currency union, he is dismissed out of hand by the scottish national party? if and when the secretary of state does speak to the first minister, will he remind him that any attempt to use sterling informally without a central bank would mean that an independent scotland would not meet the terms of entry to the european union?"
1816,3/19/2014,Labour,labour,William Bain,"what could be more damaging for jobs and growth in scotland than that? there is an honourable and admirable precedent for that sort of approach, which was taken bythe last labour prime minister. when he was chancellor of the exchequer in 1997, he took the world by surprise a weekend after the election by announcing the formation of the monetary policy committee at the bank of england and transferring the power to control interest rates away from ministers and the treasury to an independent committee."
1817,4/2/2014,Conservative,conservative,Tim Yeo,"an opposition who were really concerned about consumer prices would have said,  œwe have this brilliant idea, but it can only work if we don ™t say anything about it until we are in a position to implement it.  friend is absolutely right that the low interest rates put in place by the independent bank of england have made life more difficult for savers, although, of course, the growing economy is good news for savers as well as borrowers. we have also introduced the new savings bond for pensioners, which will come into effect at the end of the year, with higher interest rates to help those in his constituency who have worked hard and saved hard."
1818,5/7/2014,Conservative,conservative,David Mowat,what discussions he has had with ministers in the scottish government on the potential role of the bank of england in the event of scotland becoming an independent country. friend for his support for the continuation of scotland within the united kingdom. the position on any currency union or central banking arrangements if scotland were to vote for independence has been made very clear recently by the chancellor and the chief secretary and also by the shadow chancellor: there will be no such arrangements.
1819,5/7/2014,Labour,labour,Ian Murray,"in the event of an independent scotland, will the bank of england ™s monetary policy committee take its instructions from the uk treasury or the scottish government? the bank of england has already sensibly engaged in technical discussions with the scottish government. friend is absolutely right that what we need in our regulation is the exercise of judgment, rather than just process."
1820,6/12/2014,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"one of the biggest errors of judgment was the abolition of the bank of england as an authority that would oversee systemic risks in our economy and monitor levels of debt, and the creation of the tripartite regime, which we have abolished.one of the new features of the financial regulation landscape is the financial policy committee, which is the group, independent of the government, that looks at systemic financial risks, seeks to spot asset booms and has the tools to do something about them   something that, sadly, was completely lacking six or seven years ago. we have given the financial policy committee far-reaching powers over capital ratios and mortgage standards, with powers to recommend limits on loans-to-income and even loans-to-value. the new powers that it will receive   subject, of course, to parliamentary approval   on being able to limit loan-to-income ratios and loan-to-value ratios for every mortgage or, indeed, as a percentage of mortgage portfolios are very powerful tools."
1821,6/24/2014,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"it is up to the bank of england to make independent judgments about when to deploythem, because, as we have learnt with such monetary and macro-prudential policies, it is better that the politicians stay out of it. i am not going to comment on interest rates because, as the right hon. gentleman should remember, the bank of england is independent, and it is for the bank to make its judgment."
1822,6/24/2014,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"let me pick him up on what he says about housing. there have been moments in the life of this house when consensuses have been formed. the conservatives voted against bank of england independence in 1998, but in the end they joined the consensus."
1823,6/25/2014,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"they voted against the move from self-regulation to statutory regulation in our financial services, but in the end they joined the consensus. the only continuity of economic policy to which this government can lay claim   apart from cuts to everything, or slash and burn, which is the government ™s only long-term economic plan   has been produced not by them, but by the bank of england. frankly, the independent bank of england has saved the government."
1824,10/23/2014,Labour,labour,Austin Mitchell,"we now have a recovery, but if interest rates are kept flat to the floor, as they have been for the six years since the crisis, and if money is printed at a record rate   through quantitative easing, we have printed Â£375 billion   there is bound, at some stage, to be a recovery. however, there are three steps that all countries should be taking, whether or not they are in the euro. first, they should be putting in place plans to deal with fiscal deficits and put them on a proper, long-term footing; secondly, they should be pursuing structural reforms, as we have done in this country, to make it easier to start and grow businesses   european countries could do more in that regard   and thirdly, and crucially, britain and america have shown that an active monetary policy, delivered by an independent central bank, can make a real difference."
1825,11/17/2014,Conservative,conservative,David Cameron,"given the signs of rather staggered growth in europe, i think the european central bank needs to take that action as well. there was a good discussion about what is happening in the eurozone. the european central bank is independent and cannot be given political direction in any way, but there is a growing global consensus that an active monetary policy is one part of a successful growth policy in the aftermath of a verysevere crash and financial squeeze."
1826,11/17/2014,Conservative,conservative,David Cameron,"the more widely that becomes understood, the easier it will be for the ecb to act. and learned gentleman. i am not going to pick over past debates, but when he led his party through the lobby opposing bank of england independence, well, that was then; and when he advocated britain joining the single currency in 2003, well, that was then."
1827,1/13/2015,Labour (Co-op),labour,Ed Balls,"we probably agree on other things these days.let me take the right hon. members know, the government have undertaken a fundamental reform of the regulatory system, and put in place the financial services act 2012 to establish a new system of specialised and focused financial services regulators. they abolished the fsa and set up new regulators within the bank of england and the independent conduct of business regulator, the financial conduct authority."
1828,2/26/2015,Conservative,conservative,Andrea Leadsom,"these reforms are designed to ensure that the conduct of firms, and with it the interests of consumers and participants in our financial markets, are at the heart of the regulatory system and are given the priority that they deserve.the recent news on the improvements that this economy has made since 2010 is to be welcomed and shows that this government ™s long-term economic plan is working, but we have a long way to go to restore the public finances, and the public purse remains very constrained. member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath (mr brown) did when in office. there were some mistakes but also some good things, not least making the setting of interest rates independent through the central bank   a very positive step."
1829,3/19/2015,Liberal Democrat,Others,Vincent Cable,"supporting science was another positive step, as was the establishment of the low pay commission as a mechanism for deciding what is in the national interest as far as the minimum wage is concerned, and how we balance the perfectly natural wish of working people to see their wages rise with the overall interests of the economy and employment.what was alarming about the comments of the leader of the opposition yesterday was that he now wishes to turn that valuable inheritance into a political football. thanks to this government, the british people will at last have their say on british membership of the european union. the bank of england is of course independent, and any questions about publication should be directed to it."
1830,6/16/2015,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"the priority of the british government is clear: the best outcome for the uk economy is that we achieve major economic reform of the european union for the benefit of britain and for the whole of europe. that is why the prime minister and the rest of the government are now fighting hard to achieve that, and we are confident we will succeed. the bank of england may be operationally independent, but does the chancellor agree that parliament and the treasury committee are likely to see the bank as having a duty to share its thinking, at least as far as it affects its statutory objectives of monetary and financial stability, on the impact of the uk ™s membership of the eu?"
1831,6/16/2015,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"i welcome the hon. lady to her new position as shadow chief secretary   long may she continue in it. it is not for me or even, dare i say it, her to tell an independent bank of england what to do."
1832,6/16/2015,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"i have no doubt that it will engage in the debate. i have no doubt that the treasury committee, when it is formed, will want to ask the bank of england questions about the european union, because it is central to many of the bank ™s responsibilities. however, as i have said, we have an independent central bank and i propose to keep it that way."
1833,6/16/2015,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"i never thought that i would hear the member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath admit that the gold was sold off at the wrong price   i welcome the hon. gentleman to the house. with the royal bank of scotland we have a serious decision to make: do we continue to believe that at some point we might get back the money that the previous labour government put in, or do we take the advice of the independent reports that have been commissioned, and of the governorof the bank of england, which is that now is the right time to start selling rbs, and indeed that that might stimulate a higher share price?"
1834,6/16/2015,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"above all, it will help to support the british banking system. i think that as soon as we can get that business back into the private sector, the more we can support the general economy, and indeed give a great future for the rbs work force. with this it will be convenient to discuss the following:amendment 49, pageÂ 1,Â lineÂ 7,Â leave out  œ31 december  and insert  œ1 july the amendment would require the referendum to take place before 1 july 2017.amendment 50, pageÂ 1,Â lineÂ 8,Â leave out  œ2017  and insert  œ2016 the amendment would require the referendum to take place before 31 december 2016.amendment 4, pageÂ 1,Â lineÂ 8,Â at end insert    ˜(3a) no later than ten weeks before the date on which the referendum is to be held the secretary of state must lay before both houses of parliament an independent report by the office for budget responsibility on the implications for the sustainability of the public finances of the united kingdom leaving the european union. .the amendment would require the secretary of state to publish, ten weeks before the referendum, a report by the obr on the consequences of the united kingdom leaving the european union.amendment 5, pageÂ 1,Â lineÂ 8,Â at end insert    ˜(3a) no later than ten weeks before the date on which the referendum is to be held the secretary of state must lay before both houses of parliament a report on the consequences of the united kingdom leaving the european union for each ministerial departments ™ responsibilities. .the amendment would require the secretary of state to publish, ten weeks before the referendum, a report by each secretary of state on the consequences of the united kingdom leaving the european union for their areas of ministerial responsibility.amendment 6, pageÂ 1,Â lineÂ 8,Â at end insert    ˜(3a) no later than ten weeks before the date on which the referendum is to be held the secretary of state must ask for and lay before both houses of parliament any assessment made by the bank of england on the consequences of the united kingdom leaving the european union. .the amendment would require the secretary of state to publish, ten weeks before the referendum, any assessment by the bank of england on the consequences of the united kingdom leaving the european union.amendment 46, pageÂ 1,Â lineÂ 8,Â at end insert    ˜(3a) no later than ten weeks before the date on which the referendum is to be held the secretary of state must lay before both houses of parliament a report by the office for budget responsibility on the consequences for the transatlantic trade and investment partnership of the united kingdom leaving or remaining a member of the european union. the amendment would require the secretary of state to publish, ten weeks before the referendum, a report by the obr on the consequences for ttip of leaving or remaining a member of the european union.amendment 47, pageÂ 1,Â lineÂ 8,Â at end insert    ˜(3a) no later than ten weeks before the date on which the referendum is to be held the secretary of state must lay before both houses of parliament a report on the consequences for negotiations on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership of the united kingdom leaving or remaining a member of the european union. the amendment would require the secretary of state to publish, ten weeks before the referendum, a report on the consequences for negotiations on ttip of leaving or remaining a member of the european union.amendment 54, pageÂ 1,Â lineÂ 8,Â at end insert    ˜(3a) before appointing a day under subsection (2) the secretary of state shall lay before both houses a report on materials which any minister of the crown, government department or local authority or any other person or body whose expenses are defrayed wholly or mainly out of public funds or by any local authority intend or expect to publish in the period of 28 days ending with the date of the referendum that   (a) deals with any of the issues raised by any question on which the referendum is being held;(b) puts any argument for or against any particular answer to any such question;

1837,11/5/2015,Labour,labour,Richard Burgon,"how we treat rbs now will demonstrate whether we have learned the lessons of the crisis    monetary policy has been run by the bank of england independently, and i am sure that the scottish national party will continue to support the bank ™s independence against the inflationary tendencies of the hon. member for hayes and harlington (john mcdonnell)."
1838,12/1/2015,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"alongside that, we have made the isa more generous and have created new pension flexibility, so that people can get the most out of their pension savings. the low interest rates, decided independently by our central bank, are part of the vital support for our economy going forward. gentleman is absolutely correct that the bill focuses specifically on the role of the national audit office, one independent arm of government, and the bank of england, another independent agency."
1839,2/1/2016,Conservative,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"the bill does not particularly focus on the role of auditors in private companies, but i am sure other parts of parliament will consider that in this session.i turn first to the reforms that the bill will make to the bank of england. this is not simply an academic concern. we are potentially enabling a governor to pack his board with worthies happy to do his bidding and thereby outweigh the influence of the bank ™s independent directors.as mark carney begins the second half of his term, we have seen in the past week the swooning of the financial press over mario draghi ™s decisive actions aspresident of the european central bank."
1840,2/1/2016,Conservative,conservative,Mark Field,"this cult of the central banker is nothing new   it goes back to the 1920s and the greater control central banks had in the aftermath of world war one   but i have long been sceptical about the practicality, or even the desirability, of fully fledged bank of england independence. in the final analysis, strategic economic decision making must lie with elected politicians operating within financially responsible ministries. the co-ordination of monetary and fiscal policy is vital in any economic policy."
1841,2/1/2016,Plaid Cymru,Others,Jonathan Edwards,"i understand that the central bank is politically independent, but there is obvious co-ordination between the treasury and the central bank. similar protocols and links need to be developed with the welsh, scottish and northern irish exchequers. i am not sure that cag access will be enough."

1843,2/1/2016,Conservative,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"in fact, labour members, by declining to give this bill a second reading tonight, are showing once again that they would be a risk to the livelihoods of everyone, most especially the poorest and the oldest, if they were ever to return to power, because their shadow chancellor opposes giving a second reading to this entirely sensible bill due to his opposition to the independence of the bank of england   gordon brown ™s best decision. his reasoned amendment says that œthe bill fails to increase oversight and accountability of the work of the bank of england .i thought it might be interesting to see exactly what the shadow chancellor means by that. in setting up his review of monetary policy, he said: œperhaps we should be even bolder, creating a national investment bank and using newly printed money to fund it. he does not need me to criticise that as a terrible idea that would cause inflation   he should look no further than his predecessor as shadow chancellor, the hon."
1844,2/1/2016,Conservative,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"member for nottingham east (chris leslie), who said: œprinting money and ending bank of england independence would push up inflation, lending rates, squeeze out money for schools and hospitals and mean spending more on debt servicing. higher inflation and a higher cost of living would hit those on the lowest incomes, the poorest people who couldn ™t afford those goods and services. that is the reality of the opposition ™s economic policies with regard to the bank of england. i do worry about the hon."

1846,2/1/2016,Conservative,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"he said in a recent article for the new statesman: œwe are in search of good ideas ¦the new labour party still doesn ™t have many economic policies to speak of...the new labour leaders are not economists and are going to have to learn fast. this debate shows that they have not learned anything.while the snp ™s reasons for opposing the bill ™s second reading show some common ground with labour ™s, the snp is at the other end of the spectrum in thinking that the bill fails to provide sufficient independence from direct political interference for the bank of england. they cannot both be right; indeed, they are both wrong. the bill strikes the right balance on operational independence at the bank of england and the fca, and scrutiny by the people in the form of the treasury committee and the elected government.i will now address some of the points raised in the debate."
1847,2/1/2016,Conservative,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,i noticed that the hon. the first is the feeling that the fsa ™s independence has been compromised and that its agenda is being set by political pressure from the government. such independence was called into question by a recent external review that said the fsa board ™s powers œwith respect to making independent decisions were limited and that external interventions œcan have dramatic effects on the organisation .this coincided with stories in the media that the bank of england was directly involved in the highly criticised decision by the fsa to axe the review into the culture at some of the uk ™s biggest banks.then there is the chancellor ™s influence over sacking or appointing chief executives to the fsa.
1848,3/1/2016,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"the idea that the us treasury secretary, the head of the international monetary fund and, indeed, the governor of the central bank of china dance to a british tune is, i am afraid, fanciful. governors  of central banks and the finance ministers of the g20 are saying the same thing as every major independent economic institution: that a british exit would cause an immediate economic shock and have longer economic costs. i totally understand why many of the people advocating exit want to do so, but, to be frank, they accept that there would be a short-term and potentially long-term economic cost."
1849,3/16/2016,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"is not one of the problems faced by any government the fact that the so-called independent forecasts by the obr and the bank of england are always wrong and that they are always changing them? those forecasts can have more of an impact on the budget than common-sense judgments about where the economy is going, because we are always dealing with the errors of the obr. in my party, we have always maintained that we need to split retail and investment banking."
1850,3/16/2016,Plaid Cymru,Others,Jonathan Edwards,"it is interesting that sir mervyn king, the former governor of the bank of england, and sir john vickers, the chair of the independent commission on banking, which was set up following the crash in 2008, have called for greater safeguards and criticised the treasury for watering down plans to rein in the banks and reduce the risk of a future banking collapse. given the darkening global economic skies and the possible exposure of london banks to the slowdown in emerging markets, we were very disappointed that there were no measures in the budget to protect the public from another banking failure.we are also very disappointed that there was no guarantee in the budget that welsh public sector pension assets would be pooled into a welsh-specific fund for investment in welsh infrastructure. it is important to recognise the reputation associated with a name built up over such a long period."
1851,4/19/2016,Conservative,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"during that time, the bank has come to be globally renowned as a strong, independent central bank. we should not underestimate the importance of that. obviously the central bank is independent, but there is undoubtedly co-ordination with the treasury, as would be expected."
1852,5/19/2016,Labour,labour,John Healey,"by the way, that is still 24% below the peak during labour ™s 13 years in office. because growth in new house building has been so sluggish under this government   astonishingly, it has been only 2% on average since 2010   if they do not improve that run rate, they will not hit their target until 2033.some of the best policies are bigger than party politics and capable of commanding a broad consensus, such as bank of england independence, the national planning act for major infrastructure projects and the localisation of council housing finance. under the neighbourhood planning and infrastructure bill, there is a welcome commitment to put the national infrastructure commission on a statutory footing."
1853,5/25/2016,Conservative,conservative,Alun Cairns,"the welsh economy is showing some spectacular employment figures at the moment, with more people in work than ever before, the claimant count falling and an unemployment rate well below the uk average. this economic success is based on a stable economic policy, and all the independent forecasts from the oecd, the imf, the governor of the bank of england and my right hon. friend the chancellor show that there would be a negative impact should we leave the single european market."
1854,5/25/2016,Conservative,conservative,Alun Cairns,"friend is of course failing to recognise that independent forecasters   whether the imf, the oecd or the governor of the bank of england   have talked about the negative impact brexit would have on the welsh economy. a Â£2 billion reduction in the scale of the economy, costing 24,000 jobs, is a step we cannot afford to take. i do not believe that that uncertainty is a price worth paying."
1855,6/15/2016,Labour,labour,Caroline Flint,"unless the governor of the bank of england and almost every independent economic forecaster are wrong, the uk will lose business, trade, jobs and investment if we leave, landing the government with lower tax revenues. that means less money for our hospitals and schools. the shadow chancellor raised questions about monetary policy."
1856,6/29/2016,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"obviously the bank of england is independent. the mpc set out the challenging trade- off it might face between a fall in output and a rise in inflation. we must now respond to developments in the real economy, which will require a supreme national effort.first, we must look to support demand and ensure that credit flows freely in our economy."
1857,7/4/2016,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"the governor of the bank of england said on friday that œsome monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer .thanks to the reforms that i introduced, the independent bank of england has the tools that it needs to act against the cycle and support lending in the economy. the financial policy committee will publish its decisions tomorrow, and we stand ready in the treasury to act in concert with the bank of england should more need to be done to support funding for lending.the second part of our national effort must be to maintain britain ™s fiscal credibility. a number of other tools, including counter-cyclical financial tools, are available, which means that there is a range of options to deploy."
1858,7/4/2016,Conservative,conservative,George Osborne,"over the coming weeks, we will hear whether, how and why the bank of england, which is independent in its decision making, needs to deploy those tools.i am rather disappointed that the snp spokesman has not reminded us that it was snp policy to cut corporation tax. indeed, that has been its policy for year after year. gentleman for giving us the opportunity to discuss it.let me begin by setting out briefly the bank of england ™s role in the monetary policy of this country."
1859,9/15/2016,Conservative,conservative,Simon Kirby,"the first thing to stress is that the bank of england, and its monetary policy committee, are rightly independent from the government. the mpc holds responsibility for setting monetary policy to meet its clearly defined objectives, as set out in law. he talked about how there was going to be hyperinflation and it did not happen, and about how the whole issue of qe was hotly debated at the time."
1860,9/15/2016,Conservative,conservative,Simon Kirby,"i imagine that it is something that we will continue to hotly debate for some time.to conclude, the independent mpc of the bank of england has a hugely important role to play in these difficult times in maintaining monetary stability in this country. it has taken a range of steps to achieve this objective and will be closely monitoring the impact of this action. we have already seen that the consequences of the referendum, at least in the short term, will not be as severe as it imagined."
1861,10/17/2016,Conservative,conservative,Robert Jenrick,"i hope the bank of england   of course, it is independent   does not reduce interest rates further, and that we can now move away from the policy of quantitative easing as soon as possible for many reasons, but particularly for the sake of pensioners and savers.i want the government to create a long-term strategy on saving that tries to change the culture in this country towards looking to the future and putting money aside. the government need to back that in many ways, some of which will involve extremely difficult decisions. i welcomed those forecasts at the time and held to them throughout the past year."
1862,3/8/2017,Conservative,conservative,John Redwood,"i am delighted that the treasury has now largely backed those more sensible forecasts.however, we need to ask why the treasury, the office for budget responsibility, the bank of england and many other independent forecasters got the forecasts so comprehensively wrong in the summer of 2016, and why the autumn statement forecasts were still so wrong at the end of last year. i wonder whether we need some efficiency improvements in their economic forecasting departments. gentleman misstates the position."
1863,7/18/2017,Conservative,conservative,Steve Barclay,"it is an independent responsibility of the bank of england to address that    [interruption.] it is. it is of course an area where there will always be frequent discussions with the treasury, but it is a bank of england matter. that is one of the reasons why we need to make sure that we are reducing our debt and reducing our deficit in order to reduce the interest payments that came as a result of the previous labour government leaving us with the highest deficit in history."
1864,10/24/2017,Conservative,conservative,Elizabeth Truss,"we have an independent bank of england, and it is very important that as a government minister i do not tell it what to do on interest rates. yes, from north wales   even better. the chancellor has also delivered a budget at a time when growth has slowed because of the initial impact of the brexit vote: devaluation and the effect of that on consumer demand.the background is also one in which monetary policy is not of much assistance."
1865,11/28/2017,Conservative,conservative,Kenneth Clarke,"because of the actions the independent bank of england had to take after the crisis, we are still being sustained by the aftermath of quantitative easing and quite artificially low interest rates, with the governor having little opportunity to move rapidly to get back to something like normality. those interest rates are actually having a distorting effect on some aspects of the markets inside this country. on the particular point about tertiary legislation and the financial regulation system, i feel sure that when the hon."
1866,12/12/2017,Conservative,conservative,Steve Baker,"lady and i served together on the treasury committee she would have been as indefatigable a defender of the independence of the bank of england as i would have been. surely she does not want to undermine that. in the latest round, the banks came through very strongly   not a single one failed."
1867,12/18/2017,Conservative,conservative,Mel Stride,"the tests stress the system to a greater extent than the effect of the last financial crash in 2008, so we can be certain that the measures the government have put in place, the operation of the independence of the bank of england and carrying those things through are having the desired effect that he rightly seeks. i, too, look forward with great interest to hearing from opposition front benchers. has not part of the government ™s overall approach been to back the independence of the bank of england?"
1868,12/18/2017,Conservative,conservative,Rachel Maclean,"has that not also helped the overall regulation of banks, and ended the situation which, under labour, led to some of the problems in the banking sector? since then, of course, we have fundamentally changed the structure of the oversight of banks. we have ensured that the bank of england is at the heart of it, and that the independence of the bank and the other institutions that we have set up is paramount."
1869,12/18/2017,Conservative,conservative,Mel Stride,"that is partly why the position of the banks is so much stronger than it has been hitherto.we prevented the banks from reducing their corporation tax liabilities when they were required to pay compensation for misconduct, effectively applying additional taxes. lady wants to take back to the conservative party the independence of the bank of england, she should feel free. we will not support it     [interruption.] that is what i heard her say."
1870,12/18/2017,Labour,labour,Peter Dowd,"she was complaining about the independence of the bank of england. so a new policy has been introduced by the conservatives to take away the independence of the bank of england.to offset the cuts to the bank levy, the government introduced the 8% corporation tax surcharge, which they falsely claimed would offset the reduction. if we look at their red book and the forecasts from the office for budget responsibility, however, we can clearly see that the surcharge will not make up the fall in the bank levy."
1871,1/23/2018,Labour,labour,Bridget Phillipson,"it is also worth stressing that this appointment represents one of 10 places on the board, four of whom were nominated by the main political parties. as the leader of the house set out, the appointments panel was composed of joanna place, the chief operating officer at the bank of england, who served as our independent chair; sir john holmes, the chair of the electoral commission; and me, as the representative of the speaker ™s committee on the electoral commission.with the support of independent consultants, and following an open advertisement, a long list and short list were drawn up. five very strong candidates were selected for interview, and following a comprehensive and lengthy interview process, the panel concluded that professor sir ian kennedy was the strongest candidate, and unanimously recommended his appointment."
1872,7/3/2018,Conservative,conservative,Philip Hammond,"friend asks about parliament ™s role in dealing with the onshoring of a very large number of financial services regulations. some of them will be dealt with through a parliamentary process, but other areas of financial services regulation are dealt with by the independent regulators   the financial conduct authority and the bank of england. i will write to her and give her as much detail as i can about how that will break down between the different categories."
1873,10/30/2018,Conservative,conservative,Neil O'Brien,"let us not promise people things we cannot deliver.thirdly, let us not be complacent about managing our debt. sometimes people say,  œoh well, after the second world war we had huge debts that were 250% of gdp and that was fine.  i say to them that we used to have 25% inflation in this country, which cut through our debts pretty quickly, we did not have index-linked debt and we did not have an independent central bank. we must recognise in this house that if we run up big debts, it will be much more difficult than it ever was before to get them down."
1874,12/6/2018,Labour (Co-op),labour,Barry Sheerman,"lady for an early debate on the status and respect given to the bank of england and its governor? i have been in this house for quite some years, and i cannot remember a time when ministers have so reviled the governor of the bank of england   undermining the work that the bank is doing in independently telling us that there is no deal better than staying in the european union. can we have a debate on how the bank of england   this wonderful institution   can get back to full respect from all parties in this house?"
1875,1/14/2019,Labour (Co-op),labour,Barry Sheerman,"i campaigned to remain and i remain convinced that we should be in the european union.on a micro-level, on a bottom-up level, my sacred duty as a member of parliament is to come to this place to make sure that the health, welfare and prosperity of my constituents are not harmed in any way   that they are improved. every piece of evidence that i have seen from the bank of england, the london school of economics, and the independent think-tanks convince me that i was right when, as chairman of a select committee for 10 years, i believed that evidence-based policy was the best kind of policy. all the evidence  shows that my constituents, on any deal, will be worse off and poorer out of the european union than in the european union.this deal does not deliver what we need or want."
1876,2/7/2019,Conservative,conservative,Alan Duncan,"looking at the pictures we saw on our screens yesterday, i think it inevitable that there will be ever-deepening popular outrage in venezuela itself that is likely to express itself increasingly strongly if maduro remains in denial about humanitarian aid to the point of blocking it and forcing his people to starve in front of the world ™s television cameras at the border.on gold, there are gold reserves held by the bank of england. it holds them under a contract; it is entirely down to the bank, as an independent bank of england. it is nothing to do with this government."
1877,7/2/2019,Conservative,conservative,James Cartlidge,"friend the chancellor confirm that he is absolutely committed to maintaining the independence of the bank of england? yes, it is a vital cornerstone of our institutional structure that the bank of england remains independent, and those who have suggested that they would seek to politicise appointments to the bank of england would be doing a great disservice to this country and our economy. that means more border force staff, better transport infrastructure at our ports and more support for business readiness."
1878,9/4/2019,Conservative,conservative,Sajid Javid,"i have tasked the treasury with preparing a comprehensive economic response to support the economy if needed, and will work closely with the independent bank of england to co-ordinate fiscal and monetary policy.sensible economic policy means that we should plan for both outcomes, and we are doing so, but we should be careful not to let our focus on planning and preparedness distract us from the opportunities that lie ahead. brexit will allow us to reshape the british economy and reaffirm our place as a world-leading economic power. gentleman should know that the bank of england is independent, and therefore monetary policy decisions are independent."
1879,10/1/2019,Conservative,conservative,Sajid Javid,"i know that his friends on the opposition front bench do not recognise or respect that, but it is a very important part of our economic system. there is some concern that the way central banks have done it has not led to a fair distribution of prosperity and that the money has gone into a small number of hands, resulting in increased inequality.i am slightly worried by something that the right hon. gentleman said about monetary policy that might imply   he might disagree that this was his implication   that there should be some challenge to the independence of the central bank by the government of the day."
1880,12/19/2019,Liberal Democrat,Others,Ed Davey,"i would not welcome that, although i would certainly welcome a debate on quantitative easing. but it is important that we update our fiscal framework to remain at the leading edge of international best practice. our economic security depends on maintaining the following principles: low and stable inflation, delivering price stability; fiscal sustainability; and independent, effective institutions like the bank of england and the obr."
1881,3/11/2020,Conservative,conservative,Rishi Sunak,"these features of our framework will always be protected. the combination of what was set out this morning by the bank of england was welcome   both the interest rate cut and, more importantly, the credit easing, enabling the financial sector to be able to support sound businesses that are fundamentally in good shape but that are going to have an economic shock caused by the coronavirus, both on the demand and supply sides. it was very encouraging to hear of the close co-operation between an independent central bank and the treasury to make sure that both fiscal and monetary policy are being used to deal with the crisis.both individuals and businesses listening to the budget will welcome the many changes that the chancellor set out   the three big areas he set will be very welcome across the country, including in my constituency."
1882,3/11/2020,Conservative,conservative,Mark Harper,"one key issue that he set out, which i think is on the front page of the red book and which he referred to when he was doing some media interviews at the weekend, was trust. we need to make sure we come up with a solution that can be delivered so that it makes a difference to people quickly, which is why i am happy to work closely with unions and business groups to see what will make the most sense.on international leadership, i say to the right hon. gentleman that it was widely noticed by other countries that last week, in this country, we saw both monetary and fiscal policy   the government and the bank of england working independently but in a co-ordinated fashion to provide significant support and confidence to the economy."
1883,3/17/2020,Conservative,conservative,Rishi Sunak,"that was acknowledged by people, including the international monetary fund, which noticed what happened here and pointed at it as an example for others to follow.on the scale of our response, i ask the right hon. i think we need to do that, because we need to unpick some deep issues here and i do not think this house has understood that. although i am a big fan of the independent bank of england, and i do not think we should interfere with the setting of interest rates, i do think qe raises some political questions which are not technical and require accountability."
1884,5/11/2020,Conservative,conservative,Jeremy Hunt,"i support the government ™s caution about lifting lockdown, and i commend the prime minister for being honest about the complex choices we face.i want to focus my comments on the quality of scientific advice received by ministers. we used to have similar secrecy over the interest rate advice that was given to the chancellor. in 1997, the bank of england was made operationally independent, lines of accountability were clarified and advice was made transparent."
1885,5/11/2020,Conservative,conservative,Jeremy Hunt,"since then, inflation has not troubled the british economy. taken together, in just two months our economy contracted by 25%, the same amount that it grew by in the previous 18 years. and the independent office for budget responsibility and bank of england are both projecting significant  job losses, the most urgent challenge we now face."
1886,7/8/2020,Conservative,conservative,Rishi Sunak,"i want every person in this house and in the country to know that i will never accept unemployment as an unavoidable outcome. friend has, like roosevelt, given a masterclass in economic interventionism, but it is quite expensive. can he reassure me that he has a contingency in case the independent bank of england needs to change its stance on monetary policy because inflation begins to rise?"
1887,7/13/2020,Scottish National Party,Others,Kenny MacAskill,"scots were told that remaining in the union and brexit would assure scotland of a powerful voice in the world, while independence would mean being a small nation without influence, like ireland. i would like to wish all celebrating the hindu new year a happy navratri and the sikh community a happy vaisakhi today. 
 the bank of england is rightly independent of the government."
1888,4/13/2021,Labour,labour,Navendu Mishra,"can the minister confirm whether or not bank of england officials were requested by the treasury to make amendments to its covid corporate financing facility to suit greensill capital after the former prime minister had texted the chancellor? we are also supposed to be grateful about the 2% cut to national insurance contributions, and that the tories have so they claim reduced inflation from 11.4%, even though they were partly responsible for the high rate because of the disastrous mini-budget and the impacts of brexit. it is curious that the government tell us that they are not responsible for high inflation as it is a global issue, and that high interest rates are set by the wholly independent bank of england, but now that inflation is falling, we are to believe from the autumn statement that the government ™s actions have brought  it down."
1889,11/23/2023,Scottish National,Others,Alan Brown,"the government appear to be responsible for inflation rates only when it is good news and they are going down that is quite a trick. that is Â£1 billion that could have been spent on energy efficiency measures, infrastructure or even further energy support schemes. the bank of england sets interest rates independently, but economic inactivity and the wider state of the labour market is a feature of our economy that will influence whether the prime minister is able to meet his promise to halve inflation."
1890,6/19/2023,Labour Party,labour,Alison McGovern,"can the secretary of state tell us exactly what targets have been agreed by his department with the treasury on the role of the labour market in reducing inflation? friend knows, monetary policy is the responsibility of the independent monetary policy committee and the bank of england. we will continue to work closely with them to ensure that monetary and fiscal policy are well co-ordinated."
1891,10/11/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Andrew Griffith,"friend knows, the bank of england sets monetary policy, including interest rates, independently of government. at his spring statement, the chancellor was very clear about the bank of england ™s continued remit, beyond which it remains operationally independent. it has been a long-standing feature of this house that treasury ministers do not tell the bank of england how to run monetary policy."
1892,2/9/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Andrew Griffith,"there are a number of mechanisms in the uk ™s domestic framework that allow the treasury to hold the regulators to account. for example, under section 1s of the financial services and markets act and section 7f of the bank of england act 1998, the treasury  œmay appoint an independent person to conduct a review of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness  of the use of resources by the fca and the pra respectively. i am not aware of that mechanism having been used, but it strikes me as a particularly useful one."
1893,2/9/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Andrew Griffith,"house adjourned. the independent governor of the bank of england is, of course, right. today we have seen strong print on wage growth, in part due to the 9.7% increase in the national living wage, on which i hope members will join me in congratulating the government."
1894,10/24/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Andrew Griffith,"the second departmental request relates to capital funding for the bank of england. since 2009, the asset purchase facility, a subsidiary entity of the bank of england, has been a policy tool of the independent monetary policy committee. the apf supported the mpc ™s objective of stimulating the economy to try to keep inflation at its 2% target."
1895,12/7/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Andrew Griffith,"i will try to indulge him, but he will also recognise that the bill is about putting enabling powers in place, and there will be opportunities on future occasions to discuss how we deploy those. new clause 18 introduces a requirement for the regulators to ensure that all members of their statutory panels are external and independent of the treasury, the bank of england and the regulators. that will codify the current approach taken by regulators, putting it in statute, building confidence in their independence and ensuring that it is maintained on a long-term basis."
1896,6/20/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Andrew Griffith,"we recognise that this is a concerning time for homeowners and mortgage holders, but we cannot ignore the fact, much as some may wish to, that interest rates have risen across western economies as a result of the covid pandemic and the impact of the war in ukraine. the bank of england sets the base rate, which can have an effect on mortgage pricing, and the bank has been independent since the decision of the then labour government in 1997. we remain committed to responsible management to bring inflation under control, which is the only sustainable way to lower interest rates and lower mortgage rates."
1897,5/18/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Anthony Browne,"but that it not purely a uk thing; it is a global inflation crisis. i wish to put on record my continued support for bank of england independence. the governor of the bank of england appeared before the treasury committee earlier this week, and various media reports questioned that independence, saying,  œthis shows that the bank of england cannot be trusted with inflation.  that is not true."
1898,5/18/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Anthony Browne,"monetary policy was never suited to and never aimed at dealing with the current global supply shock it is not the right tool. tax justice uk has estimated that Â£37 billion could be raised by introducing a wealth tax. the government are to blame and are allowing the bank of england, through its independence, to hit living standards as it seeks to tackle inflation."
1899,11/15/2022,Labour Party,labour,Beth Winter,"i pose this question before the autumn statement: should the bank be required in future to take account of the impact of its decisions on real incomes and on living standards measurements? much of the discussion in the house today has been about the fiscal aspects of inflation, but a huge part of the rise in inflation in this country and across the western world is the monetary system, in particular quantitative easing, which has continued long beyond the financial crisis, when it was put in place. we all know the bank of england is independent in setting interest rates, but what is the treasury ™s view on working with the bank of england to bring down inflation, bearing in mind the significant impact that quantitative easing has had on that?"
1900,6/13/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Bim Afolami,"will the minister say a bit more about that? lady knows, the path to lower interest rates is through low inflation, and the independent bank of england has the government ™s full support as it takes action to return inflation to target. the government ™s mortgage charter, brokered by my right hon."
1901,10/12/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Elizabeth Truss,"that has been very important, and i would love to see more support on delivering the energy security we need. interest rates are rising globally   that is a fact and interest rates are a decision for the independent bank of england. but i want to do all i can to help families across britain."
1902,11/22/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"did the hon. member hear the governor of the bank of england accept yesterday, as he has in earlier treasury committee sessions, that it is the bank of england taking independent decisions to tackle inflation that has led to those increases? the plan for jobs has worked well, as has the help the chancellor gave throughout the pandemic, so today, as we face this high inflation rate, we are in a position to say that we have a strong job market."
1903,5/18/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"it is also worth noting that this month marks the 25th anniversary of the independence of the bank of england. i will strike a consensual note by saying that that was a really good policy decision. we must all reiterate the importance not only of the bank of england ™s independence, but of its achieving the 2% inflation mandate."
1904,5/18/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"it is incredibly important to our constituents that we have low inflation to form the foundation for achieving economic growth. last year, our inflation rate was 11.1%; it is now down to 4.6%. it is still too high, but that is enormous progress, thanks to the independent bank of england and the decisions taken in this chamber a year ago to manage the public finances prudently, in a way that would not increase inflation."
1905,11/22/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"we need to reflect on the progress that we have made in our economy. it was only just beginning to rear its ugly head back then, and as a member of the treasury committee throughout this entire period, i have been like cassandra in highlighting some of the inflationary risks that we faced. far from being transitory, as the independent bank of england hoped, inflation has become quite deeply embedded in the uk economy in wage inflation and in expectations."
1906,3/15/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"that is why i welcome the news today that the obr is expecting inflation to go back down to 2.9% by the end of this year. inflation is the worst tax that we have on our economy. it is a tax paid particularly by the very poorest, who spend the highest proportion of their income on food and energy, so the chancellor must not listen to the siren voices urging him to increase or abandon the inflation target that he gives to the independent bank of england."
1907,3/15/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"the top priority for our economy this year must be to at least halve inflation. it is a tax that harms everyone, but it harms the poorest most. does the minister agree that, while government fiscal policy this year needs to help in terms of halving inflation, the primary responsibility for getting inflation under control has been set in a remit letter given to the independent bank of england?"
1908,3/23/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Harriett Baldwin,"it is the bank ™s job to make sure that inflation gets back in its box. then the continued printing of money through the qe scheme was one, but not the only, cause of the increase in inflation that we have seen. the government say that they are not responsible for the increase in inflation to 11.1% of course recognising the independence of the bank of england, but let us not kid ourselves about the alignment that takes place but much of that increase in inflation was a failure of  policy, in particular a failure of policy at the time of covid."
1909,11/22/2023,Scottish National,Others,Ian Blackford,"let us accept some responsibility where it is necessary to do so. the snp ™s approach to creating scotland ™s reserves, which would be a fraction of those of other countries, is to borrow. the snp ™s proposition for independence is to continue to use the pound while setting up its own central bank, being a scottish lender of last resort and borrowing tens of billions of pounds to create reserves for a new currency."
1910,11/2/2022,Labour Party,labour,Ian Murray,"the very foundation of the new state would be built on unfunded, unforecasted borrowing. lady may have forgotten that her socialist friend, the then chancellor of the exchequer, gordon brown, gave the bank of england independence on monetary policy in 1997. finally, let me conclude on my right hon."
1911,9/16/2021,Conservative Party,conservative,Jacob Rees-Mogg,"friend the hon. lady made some important points about inflation, but she will of course remember that monetary policy is run independently by the bank of england, as a result of a decision taken by gordon brown when he was the chancellor of the exchequer in 1997. the main control of inflation therefore rests with an independent body, but her majesty ™s government are doing their side of the bargain, although opposed by the opposition, in ensuring that fiscal policy is responsible."
1912,1/20/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Jacob Rees-Mogg,"that does not mean that every problem is removed. everyone accepts that inflation is a problem, but, of course, monetary policy is the independent responsibility of the bank of england an independent responsibility given to it by one mr gordon brown, who i seem to remember was a socialist chancellor of the exchequer who therefore delegated the primary responsibility for inflation to the bank of england. on bills, the government are looking carefully at the recommendations of the joint committee on the draft online safety bill, which were extremely helpful."
1913,1/31/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Jacob Rees-Mogg,"she is currently an independent member of the university of warwick remuneration committee. she has previously held a number of senior management positions at the bank of england, including being the director of independent evaluation. before working for the bank, she was a journalist, as economics editor, at the times."
1914,11/22/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,James Cartlidge,"the obr forecast the uk ™s inflation rate to be 9.1% this year and 7.4% next year, although i note that the obr has said that actions taken as part of the autumn statement will help inflation to fall sharply from the middle of next year. tackling high inflation needs fiscal and monetary policy to work together, with the government and the independent bank of england acting hand in glove. it also needs the world to believe that this country will always pay what it owes."
1915,11/22/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,James Cartlidge,"the answer is that this year, this country will have to find an additional Â£150 billion to pay for the higher cost of energy that is the equivalent of an entire nhs. yes, we are taking difficult decisions, but that is the best way to ensure that we get inflation down, in partnership with the independent bank of england, and build the platform of stability that businesses need to grow and invest. on the point about brexit, if it was causing the problems, why do the netherlands and germany have higher inflation?"
1916,1/31/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,James Cartlidge,"lady is an experienced colleague. she is well aware that we have an independent bank of england, and interest rates are its responsibility. the crucial thing is that we need to work in partnership with the bank, and we do that by ensuring that fiscal policy does everything possible to support a stable framework in which inflation falls."
1917,1/31/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,James Cartlidge,"he talks up this country and he is right: the facts back that up and show that we should be optimistic. of course there are challenges, and we want to get on top of them, which is why we must work hard to support our independent bank of england in getting inflation down. but, like him, i am optimistic that if we do that, we can see the sort of growth we had last year."
1918,11/28/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,James Cartlidge,"it is our duty to curb rising prices, restore faith in our country ™s economic credibility internationally and, ultimately, to deliver growth. the independent bank of england is responsible for controlling inflation. however, as the chancellor set out in the autumn statement, monetary and fiscal policy need to move in lockstep."
1919,11/28/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,James Cartlidge,"today the government are tacking forward specific tax measures in this bill to help stabilise the public finances and provide certainty for markets. this is an important part of the government ™s broader commitments made in the autumn statement on fiscal sustainability, ensuring that we take a responsible approach to fiscal policy, tackling the scourge of inflation and working hand in hand with the independent bank of england. we will do this fairly; we will give a safety net to our most vulnerable, we will invest for future generations, and we will ensure that we grow the economy and improve  the lives of people in every part of the united kingdom."
1920,11/28/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,James Cartlidge,"the measures in this autumn finance bill are a key part of those plans, and i therefore commend it to the house. the opposition accept the independence of the bank of england, unlike some government members, but frankly that was a fairly shameless attempt by the hon. member to distance herself from what the government did to the economy last year in their disastrous mini-budget."
1921,6/26/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Jeremy Hunt,"gentleman ™s comments. it is important, because we respect and support the independence of the bank of england, that i allow the governor to make those judgments. i disagree with the right hon."
1922,10/17/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Jeremy Hunt,"i think there is also agreement on the process of policy making. i support the independence of the bank of england, introduced by gordon brown, and i know the hon. lady supports the independence of the office for budget responsibility, set up by george osborne."
1923,10/17/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Jeremy Hunt,"i can absolutely give him that assurance. i want, to be frank, to ensure that i am getting advice from fantastic institutions such as the treasury, the bank of england and the office for budget responsibility, but also advice that is independent of those institutions, because that is how we will get the best result. rupert harrison in particular has enormous experience of running the treasury under george osborne over many years, and i think that he will make an important contribution, as will his colleagues on the council."
1924,10/17/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Jeremy Hunt,"what we can do is the thing that is within our power, which is a very firm and clear commitment to fiscal responsibility. the bank of england governor himself has been very open about the fact that the bank ™s inflation forecasting has not been accurate, and it is conducting an independent review to see how it can do that better. it is clear that there have been some issues with how that process has worked, but what i would say to my right hon."
1925,11/17/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Jeremy Hunt,"the international monetary fund expects one third of the world ™s economy to be in recession this year or next. so the bank of england, which has done an outstanding job since its independence, now has my wholehearted support in its mission to defeat inflation and i today confirm we will not change its remit. but we need fiscal and monetary policy to work together, and that means the government and the bank working in lockstep."
1926,3/15/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Jeremy Hunt,"inflation destroys the value of hard-earned pay, deters investment and foments industrial strife. this government remain steadfast in our support for the independent monetary policy committee at the bank of england as it takes action to return inflation to the 2% target. despite continuing global instability, the obr reports today that inflation in the uk will fall from 10.7% in the final quarter of last year to 2.9% by the end of 2023."
1927,11/22/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Jeremy Hunt,"i will not take risks with inflation, and the obr confirms that the measures i take today make inflation lower next year than it would otherwise have been. i thank the independent bank of england monetary policy committee for its crucial role in bringing inflation down, and we will continue to back it to do whatever it takes until the job is done. but as we do, we will continue to support families in difficulty, and today i add four further measures to help with the cost of living."
1928,5/9/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,John Glen,"i absolutely agree. the government are doing three things to reduce inflation: we are remaining steadfast in supporting the independent monetary policy committee at the bank of england as it continues to take action to return inflation to target; we are making responsible decisions on tax and spending, so that we are not adding fuel to the fire; and we are tackling high energy prices by holding down energy bills for households and businesses, alongside investing in long-term energy security. as ever, my right hon."
1929,11/18/2021,Conservative Party,conservative,John Glen,"where synthetic libor is used in contracts, it is appropriate that the fca takes technical decisions on the methodology. indeed, our regulatory system often sees independent bodies empowered to produce calculations that reflect and influence economic reality, such as the bank of england setting base rates. a question raised on second reading from the opposition benches in the other place concerned whether the government would consider giving compensation to consumers who lose out from synthetic libor that echoes the question from my right hon."
1930,6/13/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,John Glen,"members would expect, the treasury has a strong and frequent dialogue with different members of the bank of england and deputy governors. however, our main inflation tools for an independent monetary policy fiscal responsibility and supply-side activism will remain the best weaponry for dealing with the challenges we face, and we will work in a co-ordinated fashion with an independent bank of england to address those pressures. i beg to move an amendment, to leave out from  œhouse  to the end of the question and add:  œwelcomes the government ™s drive to halve inflation, grow the economy and reduce debt; particularly welcomes the government ™s new mortgage charter which has been agreed by 85 per cent of the residential mortgage market and will provide support to mortgage holders through new commitments and flexibilities to help borrowers who are anxious about rising interest rates; notes the extensive package of cost of living support to help families with rising prices, worth an average of Â£3,300 per household including direct cash payments to the eight million most vulnerable households; and further believes that labour ™s policies to manage the economy would be inflationary, lead to higher interest rates and put more pressure on mortgage holders and renters.  after two decades of low inflation, the world has been confronted with a bout of fast-growing prices, and we are not alone."
1931,6/27/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,John Glen,"as a result of rising prices, central banks around the world, including in the united states, japan, new zealand and the european union, have been raising interest rates in order to force down the rate of price rises. as all members will be aware, last week, the bank of england ™s independent monetary policy committee raised rates to 5%. let me say at the outset that the bank of england and its monetary policy committee has the full support and confidence of this government, and will continue to do so as it takes whatever action is necessary to return inflation to the 2% target in the medium term."
1932,6/20/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,John Glen,"the government are doing three things to reduce inflation. first, we remain steadfast in our support for the independent monetary policy committee of the bank of england as it takes action to return inflation to its 2% target. secondly, we are making difficult but responsible decisions on tax and spending so that we do not add fuel to the fire."
1933,11/21/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,John Glen,"friend, and he made the same point when i was previously at the dispatch box. as he knows, the bank of england is independent. he asks about quantitative tightening, and i am sure such matters will feature in conversations between the chancellor and the governor."
1934,11/21/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,John Redwood,"however, i do think that inflation will come down, because money has been greatly tightened. whenever i make a point about bond buying and selling, quantitative easing and money policy, i am told by all the opposition parties and by ministers that the issue is not for us mere mortals, because it is something that the bank of england does as part of its independence. i therefore need to remind the house of the constitutional position and of the deeds of this and former governments."
1935,11/21/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,John Redwood,"indeed, it is undesirable, because money policy has already been tightened a lot and that will be a further tightening. on the item where the bank of england is properly  independent and where ministers would obviously not comment, i must add that i think it is dreadful that the bank kept interest rates as low as it did last year and has not raised them sufficiently even this year at the short end. it keeps telling us it will get round to raising the rates to the level needed to kill the inflation, so i say,  œget on with it.  in the figures given today, it is suggested that the short rates will peak at 4.77% a very precise and unlikely number."
1936,11/27/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,John Redwood,"they should pause and ask why. the review also rightly says that the bank of england should be more accountable to parliament not to the government, in any way to prejudice its independence because it is in the process of losing us the most colossal sums of money. successive chancellors have guaranteed the bank of england against all losses from their bond buying programmes, which started under labour at the end of the first decade of the century and were escalated by the current government in response to covid."
1937,1/10/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,John Redwood,"the first aim that it should definitely embed is controlling inflation. it is right that the so-called independent bank of england this house regularly changes the rules and shows that it is actually in charge of the bank of england is charged with the duty of keeping inflation down to around 2% on average. i have no problem with that as a target, but the government need to adopt it as a target as well, because as ministers must well know, we cannot do all of the heavy lift through monetary policy we cannot do it all through interest rates or quantitative easing."
1938,10/11/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Kwasi Kwarteng,"the obr will be fully scoring and giving a forecast ahead of the medium-term fiscal plan. i speak very frequently to the governor of the bank of england, who is absolutely independent and is very effectively managing what is a global situation. the governor of the bank of england is entirely independent."
1939,9/23/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Kwasi Kwarteng,"we actually have very good relations. let no one doubt that, during the worst energy crisis in generations, this government are on the side of the british people. the bank of england are taking further steps to control inflation, acting again only yesterday, and i can assure the house that this government consider the bank of england ™s independence to be sacrosanct."
1940,9/23/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Kwasi Kwarteng,"we remain closely co-ordinated, with the governor and myself speaking twice a week. the chair of the committee, my hon. friend  œon this important question of mortgages, because it matters so much to our constituents...how much of the increase that you see in the mortgage market today has come from that independent decision by the bank of england to tighten monetary policy and how much has been due to the disruption to the gilt market that we saw in september and early october?  the governor answered:  œi think the september-october thing was obviously a short-lived thing...it is pretty much on the way to being gone."
1941,11/22/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Laura Farris,"that was a thing that ran from...september through to the middle of october.  with respect, if the opposition are going to keep parroting the line that this was a crisis made in downing street, it is incumbent on them to say why the governor of the bank of england is incorrect. if  we get extra inflation created by monetary expansion that is too fast, it will affect the poorest in our society and the balance of our public finances, and it will cost taxpayers money. i have no problem with the bank of england having operational independence, but what i want to know is: when it gets it wrong, who is it accountable to?"
1942,11/14/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Liam Fox,"ultimately, it is the taxpayers and the people of this country who pay the bill, not those who are well paid in the bank of england. perhaps that is an uncharitable view, and they knew all along that they would create inflation but were simply responding to their political masters. however, that raises questions about the independence of the central bank in the first place."
1943,5/12/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Liam Fox,"either way, it is a wholly unacceptable position. we must retain fiscal discipline; otherwise the problem will get worse rather than better. on monetary policy, the chancellor mentioned the independence of the bank of england decision, which has just been announced, but there is some chatter about working in tandem with the bank."
1944,2/3/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Matthew Hancock,"will he confirm that, on monetary policy not just interest-rate setting but the withdrawal of quantitative easing bank independence will be respected? that is well detached from its target of 2%, so the question arises: is the bank of england culpable for having missed that target to that extent? i want to  speak partially, at least in defence of the bank of england, which is one of the most important independent institutions in our country, and to make the following observations."
1945,5/17/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Mel Stride,"first, as the chancellor has already pointed out, the level of inflation across the world is elevated. for about 80% of the rise in inflation above the 2% target, therefore, we should not hold the bank of england particularly culpable. the notions of those people some of whom are on my side of the house who have called into question the independence of the bank of england as a consequence of high inflation are misplaced."
1946,5/17/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Mel Stride,"we should firmly defend the bank of england in that respect. finally i am aware of the time and know that many others want to speak could i touch on the bank of england and its mandate? i know that the bank of england ™s remit or mandate does not feature directly in this bill, but much has been said about it and the importance of its independence, and i want to underscore that importance in this debate."
1947,9/7/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Mel Stride,"there was a period, going back some weeks and months, when perhaps because, understandably, many members and those who are now in government may have looked at the bank of england and said that, because inflation is so far adrift from its target of 2%, it is therefore entirely unfit for purpose. i do not believe that the bank has been perfect, but i think it has faced extraordinary situations that have made its ability to keep inflation down to about 2% really a task that no central banker could have achieved. it will be vital that the bank of england maintains its independence, that politicians are kept out of monetary policy and that chancellors do not determine interest rates if we are going to have a credible approach to monetary policy and all the benefits that brings."
1948,9/7/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Mel Stride,"friend the former chancellor has said at the government dispatch box on occasion in the past,  if we take a 20-year view of the bank of england ™s performance, it has actually been spot-on at about  2%. perhaps i can leave this debate with the thought that we must guard the independence of the bank of england. naturally, there has been criticism of the bank of england, given the level of inflation and its inflation target, but among that criticism there have been reports that some in government, including perhaps one member of the cabinet, have been suggesting that the independence of the bank of england should be removed."
1949,5/17/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Mel Stride,friend agree that it is essential that our central bank is independent in order to maintain the credibility and integrity of our monetary policy? will he give a categorical assurance to the house that there are no plans of any kind to restrain the independence of our central bank? the bank of england is rightly independent of the government.
1950,7/5/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Oliver Dowden,"lady, but some leaders trust their deputies to stand in for them. when it comes to mortgage rates, i support the independence of the bank of england in taking the necessary measures to control inflation. just ask the international monetary fund what we have done to support them."
1951,10/19/2022,Labour Party,labour,Pat McFadden,"the prime minister and her ideological soulmate got the keys to the treasury ferrari, took it for a joyride and then crashed it into a ditch. now, belatedly, by commissioning the obr report and singing the praises of an independent bank of england after spending all the summer undermining it, they have signed themselves up for the speed awareness course; but it is too late, because people will continue to pay the price of what they have done. we have now had two fiscal events with no report from the obr."
1952,10/19/2022,Labour Party,labour,Rachel Reeves,"friend knows how things are supposed to be done. we cannot ask september ™s chancellor why he sacked the respected permanent secretary, because he is no longer in his place, but a labour government would respect the bank of england, respect the independent civil service and remove the gag on the office for budget responsibility. today ™s inflation numbers show the impact that higher gas and electricity bills are having on family finances."
1953,5/26/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Rishi Sunak,"since control of monetary policy was taken out of the hands of politicians 25 years ago, inflation has averaged precisely 2%. it is right that the bank of england is independent, and i know that the governor and his team will take decisive action to get inflation back on target and ensure that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored. secondly, we need responsible fiscal policy."
1954,2/3/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Rishi Sunak,"1 issue on people ™s minds is the rising cost of living. it is the independent bank of england ™s role to deliver low and stable inflation, and the governor will set out its judgments at midday today. just as the government stood behind the british people through the pandemic, so we will help people deal with one of the biggest costs they now face: energy."
1955,5/17/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Rishi Sunak,"i agree with him wholeheartedly. while we face challenges at the moment, the record of 25 years of central bank independence speaks for itself, with an average inflation rate of exactly 2%. i know all colleagues will want to make sure that we return to that as swiftly as possible, and i can assure him that that is both my and the governor ™s ambition."
1956,10/19/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Robert Buckland,"i have regular discussions with cabinet colleagues on a range of topics. of course, interest rates are rightly a matter for the independent bank of england. we have announced unprecedented support for households and businesses."
1957,7/5/2023,Conservative Party,conservative,Robert Syms,"my view is that the debt management office which has an interest because it has to sell government debt, and the bank of england selling it at the same time does not help the governor of the bank of england and the chancellor really ought to sit down a couple of times a year and agree a joint letter that sets out the parameters for how they will unscramble quantitative easing with a quantitative tightening programme, which i think the markets would understand. i do not think anybody would think we were infringing on the independence of the bank of england if we were actually trying to ensure that the taxpayer gets best value. on almost anything, any budget or taxation, the treasury is very careful in approving things."
1958,5/11/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Robert Syms,i therefore think there needs to be a rethink in this area. i am not a great fan of bank of england independence. i have always been a little sceptical about it.
1959,9/8/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Robin Walker,"friend and sometime lookalike  many constituents in ilford south will be very glad that the last labour prime minister had the foresight to make the bank of england independent, given the mini-budget a few weeks ago almost tanked six pension funds in the uk. what i would like to know from our new chancellor today is what he is going to do at least one more is still at risk to reassure pensioners in ilford south, and the millions of people across the country who are not only   angry but frightened, that he will do something concrete to shore up pension funds not just over the next few weeks but over the next few years."
1960,6/28/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,Simon Clarke,"as the chancellor told the house last month, we have three key tools at our disposal: independent monetary policy, fiscal responsibility and supply side reform. we have every confidence that the independent bank of england will take decisive action to get inflation back on target, with it having averaged precisely 2% over the last 25 years. our second tool is responsible fiscal policy."
1961,5/17/2022,Labour Party,labour,Stephen Timms,"i agree with the right hon. gentleman about the independence of the bank of england. at the liaison committee in march, he suggested to the prime minister that there should be a one-off uprating of benefits, given that inflation is much higher than the 3.1% by which uprating was applied."
1962,6/27/2023,Scottish National,Others,Stewart Hosie,"that came after the bank of england raised interest rates to 5% the 13th consecutive rise, and a larger-than-expected increase meaning that we now have the highest interest rates in 15 years. i support 100% the operational independence of the central bank, but i wonder whether that was the right approach. we all know that there is a lag between interest rates going up and the impact of driving inflation down being demonstrated."
1963,12/7/2022,Labour Party,labour,Tulip Siddiq,"we were delighted when, after much pressure from the labour party, the minister decided to drop his dangerous policy of the intervention power. despite repeated warnings from the bank of england, business and the labour party that he should not be putting the uk ™s international competitiveness at risk by threatening our system of regulatory independence, the current minister pushed on and told me it was a good thing. in my eyeline, i can see"
1964,10/19/2022,Conservative Party,conservative,William Wragg,"to see this as a question of international turbulence inexplicably increasing the mortgage rates and inexplicably necessitating further cuts to public expenditure i cannot easily forgive that. in the course of the summer, i found the trashing of the reputations of independent organisations in this country, such as the bank of england and the office for budget responsibility, to be near to malice in its nature. treasury orthodoxy came under attack."
